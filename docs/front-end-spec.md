# Pharmacy Management System UI/UX Specification

---

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Pharmacy Management System's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

*   **The Client:** An individual seeking a modern, convenient, and reliable way to manage their prescriptions. They value their time and expect a frictionless, transparent digital experience that provides peace of mind.
*   **Internal Staff (Sales, Delivery, Pharmacist):** Skilled professionals currently limited by fragmented, manual workflows. They need a unified, role-specific digital tool that provides a single source of truth, protects their focus, and eliminates operational chaos.
*   **The Manager:** A decision-maker who currently lacks real-time visibility. They need an interface that provides actionable, data-driven insights into inventory, sales, and staff activity to make proactive business decisions.

#### Usability Goals

*   **Efficiency:** Core tasks (e.g., a client submitting a prescription, a salesperson processing an order) must be demonstrably faster and require fewer steps than the current manual alternatives.
*   **Clarity & Confidence:** Users must always have a clear understanding of the status of their tasks and feel confident that the system is working reliably. The interface should eliminate the uncertainty inherent in the old manual process.
*   **Low Error Rate:** The design must actively prevent common errors, such as incorrect data entry during order creation or accidental submission of an incomplete prescription.
*   **Learnability:** New users, both clients and staff, should be able to successfully complete their primary tasks with minimal to no training, guided by an intuitive and predictable interface.

#### Design Principles

1.  **Clarity Above All:** Every interface must be unambiguous and easy to understand. We will prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation, especially given the health context of the application.
2.  **Efficiency is the Feature:** The primary goal is to save users time and mental effort. Every workflow will be optimized to be as fast and frictionless as possible.
3.  **Provide Constant Reassurance:** The system replaces an uncertain manual process. We will use clear status indicators, confirmation messages, and timely notifications to give users constant feedback and peace of mind.
4.  **Role-Focused Design:** Each user role has a different job to do. Their interface will be tailored to their specific needs, hiding irrelevant information and complexity to create a focused and powerful tool for their tasks.

## Information Architecture (IA)

The information architecture is designed to provide a clear, logical, and role-specific structure for the application. It separates the user experience into two primary contexts: the public-facing (unauthenticated) area and the secure, role-based (authenticated) areas for clients and staff.

### Site Map / Screen Inventory

This diagram illustrates the high-level structure and key screens of the application, organized by user role.

            end

            S1 --> SN[Staff Notifications]
        end
    end
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** The primary navigation will be a bottom tab bar, providing persistent access to the most critical sections for the user's role. This mobile-first pattern ensures high-priority tasks are always one tap away.

*   **For Clients:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Main landing screen with key summaries.
    *   **Submit Rx:** A dedicated, high-visibility tab for the core user action.
    *   **My Orders:** Quick access to order history and status.
    *   **Notifications:** Central hub for all updates.
*   **For Staff (Salesperson/Manager):**
    *   **Dashboard:** Role-specific overview.
    *   **Prescriptions:** The queue of pending prescriptions to be processed.
    *   **Orders:** The main order management view.
    *   **Notifications:** All relevant staff alerts.
*   **For Staff (Delivery Person):**
    *   **My Deliveries:** A focused list of assigned orders.
    *   **Notifications:** Alerts relevant to their deliveries.
    *   **Profile:** Access to account settings.

**Secondary Navigation:** Navigation to deeper screens (e.g., viewing specific order details) will be handled through a standard "stack" navigation model. Users will tap items in a list to push a new screen onto the view stack, with a clear "Back" button in the header to return to the previous screen.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Traditional web-style breadcrumbs are not applicable to this mobile application. Clear screen titles in the header will serve as the primary method of orientation, ensuring the user always knows where they are in the app.

### Dashboard Content Strategy

The dashboard is the primary landing screen for every authenticated user. Its purpose is to provide an at-a-glance summary of the most relevant information and quick access to the most critical actions for that user's role, directly supporting our "Efficiency is the Feature" design principle.

#### Client Dashboard

The client's dashboard is designed to provide immediate reassurance and easy access to the app's core function.

*   **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA):** A large, prominent "Submit New Prescription" button. This is the client's main job-to-be-done and should be the easiest action to find.
*   **Recent Order Status Card:** A dynamic card displaying the real-time status of their most recent order (e.g., "Order #12345 - In Preparation"). This directly addresses the "Provide Constant Reassurance" principle by answering the user's most likely question first. Tapping this card will navigate to the order's detail screen.
*   **Notification Summary:** A small, non-intrusive summary indicating the number of unread notifications (e.g., "You have 2 new notifications"). Tapping this navigates to the full notification list.

#### Salesperson Dashboard

The salesperson's dashboard is a command center focused on their primary workflow: processing incoming prescriptions.

*   **Actionable Stat Cards:** A set of clear, bold metric cards at the top of the screen to show the current workload:
    *   **Pending Prescriptions:** A large number indicating how many new submissions are in the queue.
    *   **Orders in Preparation:** A count of orders currently being worked on.
*   **Primary Task Button:** A "Go to Prescription Queue" button that takes them directly to the list of pending prescriptions to begin processing.
*   **Recent Activity Feed (Optional):** A short list of the 3-5 most recent events (e.g., "Prescription #P67890 submitted by J. Doe," "Order #12344 marked Ready for Delivery").

#### Manager Dashboard

The manager's dashboard provides a high-level overview of business operations and highlights urgent issues that require attention.

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** A series of summary cards displaying critical real-time business metrics for the day:
    *   Total Orders
    *   Total Revenue
    *   New Prescriptions Submitted
*   **Urgent Alerts Section:** A high-visibility section for critical alerts. The most important alert will be:
    *   **Low Stock Warning:** (e.g., "⚠️ 5 items are low on stock"). Tapping this alert navigates directly to the low-stock report.
    *   **Note for MVP:** As the low-stock report is a post-MVP feature, this alert will be a non-functional UI element or hidden in the initial release. The interaction (tapping to navigate) will be implemented in a future phase.
*   **Quick Links:** A set of navigation buttons for easy access to the core administrative sections:
    *   Manage Medications
    *   Manage Staff
    *   Manage Clients

#### Dashboard Empty States

"Empty states" occur when there is no data to display, such as on a user's first login or when a task queue is empty. These states are designed to be informative, guiding, and encouraging.

*   **Client Dashboard (First-Time Use):**
    A new client has no order history. Instead of showing a blank space where the "Recent Order Status Card" would be, the dashboard will display a welcoming "Getting Started" card.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Headline:** "Welcome to a simpler pharmacy experience!"
        *   **Body:** "Submit your first prescription to see its status here. It's fast, easy, and secure."
    *   **Interaction:** This card will be tappable and will navigate the user directly to the "Submit Prescription" screen, providing a clear and immediate path to their primary goal.
*   **Salesperson Dashboard (Empty Queue):**
    When the prescription queue is empty, it signifies that all work is complete. The dashboard should reflect this as a positive achievement.
    *   **Content:**
        *   The "Pending Prescriptions" stat card will clearly display "0".
        *   The main content area will display a positive confirmation message.
        *   **Headline:** "All Caught Up!"
        *   **Body:** "The prescription queue is clear. You'll be notified when new submissions arrive."
        *   **Visual:** A simple, positive icon (e.g., a checkmark ✅) will accompany the message.

## User Flows

This section details the step-by-step pathways for the most critical user tasks within the application. Each flow is designed to be as intuitive and efficient as possible, considering the user's goal, potential edge cases, and necessary system feedback. These flows serve as a blueprint for the interaction design of each key feature.

### User Flow: Prescription Submission (Client)

This is the primary workflow for the Client persona. The entire experience is optimized for speed, clarity, and reassurance, transforming a high-friction manual task into a simple digital one.

*   **User Goal:** To quickly and confidently submit a prescription image for processing without visiting the pharmacy.
*   **Entry Points:**
    *   Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) on the Client Dashboard.
    *   Dedicated "Submit Rx" tab in the primary navigation.
*   **Success Criteria:** The client receives an immediate on-screen confirmation with a unique reference number, and a corresponding notification is generated in their account.

#### Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the client's journey from initiation to successful submission.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Client Dashboard or Nav Tab};
    B --> C[Tap 'Submit New Prescription'];
    C --> D{Select Image Source};
    D --> E[Camera];
    D --> F[Gallery];
    E --> G[Capture Photo];
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Confirm Image Preview];
    H --> I[Tap 'Submit'];
    I --> J[App Compresses & Uploads Image];
    J --> K{Submission Status};
    K -- Success --> L[Display Confirmation Screen with Reference #];
    K -- Failure --> M[Display Error Message];
    L --> N[End];
    M --> H;
```

#### Key Screen: Confirmation

To fulfill the "Provide Constant Reassurance" principle, the confirmation screen displayed upon successful submission (Step L) is critical. It must contain:
*   **Primary Confirmation:** A large, clear headline and icon (e.g., a green checkmark ✅ with "Submission Successful!").
*   **The Reference Number:** A prominent, easy-to-copy reference number (e.g., "Your reference number is: **#P12345**").
*   **Clear Next Steps:** A brief, reassuring message setting expectations (e.g., "Our team will now review your prescription. You will be notified once it has been processed.").
*   **A Single, Clear Action:** A button to conclude the flow (e.g., "Done" or "Return to Dashboard").

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

*   **Invalid File:** If the user selects a file that is not a supported image format (JPG, PNG) or exceeds the size limit (5MB), the app will display an inline error message immediately upon selection, preventing an upload attempt.
*   **Upload Failure:** If the upload fails due to a network error or a server issue, a clear, non-dismissible message will appear (e.g., "Upload Failed. Please check your connection and try again.") with a "Retry" button.
*   **User Cancels:** If the user cancels the image selection process, they are returned to the "Submit Prescription" screen without any change.
*   **Authentication Error:** If the user's session has expired, the app will prevent the submission and gracefully redirect them to the login screen with an explanatory message.

### User Flow: Prescription Processing (Salesperson)

This workflow is the operational heart of the system for the sales staff. It's designed for maximum efficiency and accuracy, enabling a salesperson to quickly and correctly convert a client's submitted prescription into a formal order, while handling critical business logic like stock validation.

*   **User Goal:** To accurately process a pending prescription, create a new order, and ensure inventory is correctly updated, all within a single, seamless interface.
*   **Entry Points:**
    *   Tapping the "Pending Prescriptions" stat card on the Salesperson Dashboard.
    *   Tapping a specific prescription from the "Prescription Queue" screen.
*   **Success Criteria:** A new order is created with the status 'In Preparation', the original prescription's status is updated to 'Processed', inventory for the ordered items is reserved (decremented), and the client receives a notification that their order is being prepared.

#### Flow Diagram

This diagram maps the salesperson's decision-making process, from viewing the queue to successfully creating an order or rejecting an invalid submission.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: View Prescription Queue] --> B[Select a Pending Prescription];
    B --> C[View Prescription Image];
    C --> D{Is Prescription Valid & Legible?};
    D -- No --> E[Tap 'Reject'];
    E --> F[Enter Rejection Reason];
    F --> G[Confirm Rejection];
    G --> H[System updates Rx status & notifies client];
    H --> I[End];

    D -- Yes --> J[Begin Adding Medications];
    J --> K[Search for Medication];
    K --> L{Is Medication In Stock?};
    L -- No --> M[Show 'Out of Stock' error, prevent adding];
    M --> K;
    L -- Yes --> N[Add Item & Quantity to Order List];
    N --> O{Add another item?};
    O -- Yes --> K;
    O -- No --> P[Tap 'Create Order'];
    P --> Q[System validates stock in transaction];
    Q -- Success --> R[Order created, stock reserved, client notified];
    R --> I;
    Q -- Failure --> S[Display 'Stock Conflict' error];
    S --> J;
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

*   **Out of Stock:** The UI must provide real-time stock availability as the salesperson searches for medications. An out-of-stock item cannot be added to the order list, preventing errors before they happen.
*   **Invalid Prescription:** If the uploaded image is blurry, incomplete, or otherwise invalid, the salesperson has a clear "Reject" path, which requires a reason to ensure the client receives clear feedback.
*   **Concurrent Processing:** If two salespeople attempt to process the same prescription simultaneously, the system should use optimistic locking. The first to submit the 'Create Order' request will succeed. The second will receive a "This prescription has already been processed" error, preventing duplicate orders.
*   **Stock Conflict on Submission:** In the case that stock changes between adding an item and submitting the order, the system will handle the error gracefully to respect the user's effort:
    1.  **API Response:** The API will return a specific error identifying the conflicting item, its requested quantity, and the available quantity.
    2.  **UI Presentation:** The UI will **not** clear the order list. It will display an error banner and visually highlight the specific line item causing the conflict with an inline message (e.g., "Only 50 units available.").
    3.  **User Action:** The "Create Order" button will be disabled until the salesperson edits the quantity of the conflicting item or removes it, at which point the button will become active again.

## Wireframes & Mockups

This section provides a bridge between the abstract user flows and the final visual design. It outlines the source of truth for high-fidelity designs and specifies the layout and key components for the application's most critical screens.

**Source of Truth:** This document is the single source of truth for all UI/UX specifications. The screen layouts described below are the final designs and definitive blueprints for development. They define the required elements, their arrangement, and their behavior, and must be implemented directly from these specifications.

### Key Screen Layouts

The following are conceptual layouts for the core screens identified in the Information Architecture and User Flows. They define the purpose, key elements, and interaction model for each view, serving as the definitive blueprint for front-end development.

#### Screen: Prescription Submission (Client)

*   **Purpose:** To provide a fast, simple, and reassuring interface for a client to upload a prescription image. The design must minimize cognitive load and guide the user to a successful submission with confidence.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Image Placeholder/Preview:** A large, central area that either prompts the user to add an image or displays a clear preview of the selected image.
    *   **"Select Image" Button:** A primary button that opens the device's native camera or photo gallery selector.
    *   **"Submit" Button:** The final call-to-action, which should be disabled until an image has been selected and previewed.
    *   **Helper Text:** A brief, clear instruction (e.g., "Please upload a clear photo of your entire prescription.").
*   **Interaction Notes:**
    *   Upon tapping "Select Image," the user is presented with a choice ("Take Photo" or "Choose from Gallery").
    *   Once an image is selected, it appears in the preview area. The user should have an option to clear the selection and choose a different image.
    *   Tapping "Submit" will display a non-blocking loading indicator while the image is compressed and uploaded.

#### Screen: Prescription Processing (Salesperson)

*   **Purpose:** To provide an efficient, all-in-one interface for a salesperson to review a prescription, create an accurate order, and handle exceptions like rejection or out-of-stock items. The layout must support the dual tasks of viewing an image and building an order simultaneously.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Prescription Image Viewer:** A prominent, zoomable view of the client's uploaded prescription image.
    *   **Medication Search Input:** A powerful search bar with real-time results to quickly find medications in the catalog.
    *   **Order Item List:** A running list of medications added to the order, showing name, quantity, price, and a real-time stock status indicator for each item.
    *   **Order Summary:** A section displaying the subtotal and total price, which updates as items are added or removed.
    *   **Primary Actions:** Clearly distinct buttons for "Create Order" and "Reject Prescription".
*   **Interaction Notes:**
    *   The layout should be optimized for a mobile screen, potentially using a top/bottom split view or a tabbed interface to switch between the image and the order form.
    *   As the salesperson types in the search bar, a list of matching medications appears. Tapping a result adds it to the order list with a default quantity of 1.
    *   The quantity of each item in the list should be easily editable.
    *   The "Create Order" button remains disabled until at least one valid, in-stock medication is added to the list.
    *   Tapping "Reject Prescription" will open a modal dialog requiring a reason for rejection before proceeding.

#### Screen: Manager Dashboard

*   **Purpose:** To serve as the manager's command center, providing a high-level, at-a-glance overview of business operations and immediately surfacing critical issues that require their attention. The design must facilitate proactive, data-driven decision-making.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **KPI Summary Cards:** A row of prominent, easy-to-read cards at the top of the screen displaying the day's key metrics (e.g., "Total Orders," "Total Revenue," "New Prescriptions").
    *   **Urgent Alerts Section:** A visually distinct section directly below the KPIs, designed to draw immediate attention. It will feature a high-priority alert for "Low Stock Items" with a clear warning icon (⚠️) and a count of affected items.
    *   **Management Quick Links:** A grid or list of clearly labeled buttons that provide one-tap access to the core administrative functions ("Manage Medications," "Manage Staff," "Manage Clients").
*   **Interaction Notes:**
    *   The KPI cards are primarily for quick-look information. In a future version, tapping them could lead to more detailed reports.
    *   Tapping the "Low Stock Items" alert is a critical action. It will navigate the manager directly to the low-stock report screen, bypassing any intermediate menus.
    *   Each "Quick Link" button navigates directly to its corresponding management screen.

#### Screen: Salesperson Order Management View

*   **Purpose:** To provide the salesperson with a clear, organized, and actionable view of the entire order fulfillment pipeline. The interface must make it easy to track orders, understand their current status, and perform the necessary actions to move them through the workflow.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Status Tabs:** A tabbed navigation bar at the top of the screen to filter the order list by its most relevant statuses (e.g., "In Preparation," "Ready for Delivery," "Completed"). This is the primary organizational paradigm for the screen.
    *   **Order List:** Below the tabs, a scrollable list of orders that dynamically updates based on the selected status tab.
    *   **Order Card:** Each item in the list will be a self-contained card summarizing the most important order information: Order ID, Client Name, Time since order creation, and Total Amount.
    *   **Search/Filter Bar (Optional but Recommended):** A search bar above the tabs to allow finding a specific order by ID or client name, which is crucial for handling customer inquiries.
*   **Interaction Notes:**
    *   The screen will default to the "In Preparation" tab, as this is the most actionable queue for the salesperson.
    *   Tapping on an Order Card will navigate the user to a detailed "Order Details" screen where they can perform status updates (e.g., "Mark as Ready for Delivery") or other management tasks.
    *   The list should support a "pull-to-refresh" gesture to fetch the latest order data.

## Component Library / Design System

This section defines the approach to our component library and details the foundational, reusable UI components that will ensure consistency, speed up development, and create a cohesive user experience across the entire application.

#### Design System Approach

Given the project's constraints (educational capstone, single developer) and the choice of Flutter for development, our approach will be to **extend, not reinvent**. We will adopt Google's **Material Design** system as our foundational framework. This provides a robust, well-documented, and accessible set of components out of the box.

Our work will focus on:
1.  **Customization:** Applying our specific branding, color palette, and typography (as defined in the upcoming Style Guide section) to the standard Material components.
2.  **Composition:** Creating specific, reusable "composite components" from the base Material elements to handle application-specific needs (e.g., an `OrderCard` component).
3.  **Consistency:** Ensuring that any given UI element (like a primary button or a text input) looks and behaves identically wherever it appears.

#### Core Components

The following are the initial set of core components to be developed. They represent the most critical building blocks needed to construct the MVP screens.

##### Component: Primary Button
*   **Purpose:** Used for the single most important action on a screen, such as "Submit," "Create Order," or "Log In."
*   **Variants:** Filled (Default), Text Button.
*   **States:** Default, Hover, Pressed, Disabled.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** There should be only one primary, filled button visible on a screen at any time.

##### Component: Form Input Field
*   **Purpose:** To collect user-entered data in forms.
*   **Variants:** Standard Text, Password, Search.
*   **States:** Default, Focused, Error, Disabled.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Every input field must have a clear, visible label.

##### Component: Order Status Tag
*   **Purpose:** A small, colored tag used to clearly and consistently communicate the status of an order or prescription.
*   **Variants:** In Preparation, Ready for Delivery, Completed, Cancelled / Failed, Pending.
*   **States:** This component is static and primarily has one state (display).
*   **Usage Guidelines:** The color-coding must be used consistently throughout the application wherever a status is displayed.

#### Composite Components

These components are built by combining core components into reusable patterns that solve specific UI problems within our application.

##### Composite Component: OrderCard
*   **Purpose:** To display a summary of a single order in a list view, such as on the "My Orders" screen for a client or the "Order Management" screen for a salesperson. It must be scannable, informative, and tappable.
*   **Composition:** This component is composed of a `Card` container, `Text` elements, and the `Order Status Tag` component.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Top Row:** Order ID on the left, `Order Status Tag` on the right.
    *   **Middle Row:** Client Name.
    *   **Bottom Row:** Timestamp on the left, Total Amount on the right.
*   **States:** Default, Pressed (with visual feedback on tap).
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Used in any list that displays multiple orders. The layout should remain consistent across all roles to ensure familiarity.

##### Composite Component: KPI Card
*   **Purpose:** To display a single, high-level metric on the Manager Dashboard in an easily scannable format.
*   **Composition:** A `Card` container holding a large `Text` element for the value and a smaller `Text` element for the label.
*   **Layout:** The numeric value is displayed prominently with the descriptive label directly below it.
*   **States:** This is a display-only component with a single default state.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Used exclusively on the Manager Dashboard to provide an at-a-glance overview of key performance indicators.

##### Composite Component: Notification Item
*   **Purpose:** To display a single notification in a list, clearly indicating its content and read/unread status.
*   **Composition:** A `ListTile` containing an `Icon` (to indicate notification type), two `Text` elements (for title and summary), and a trailing `Text` element (for the timestamp).
*   **Layout:** Icon on the left, title and summary stacked vertically in the center, and timestamp on the right.
*   **States:**
    *   **Unread:** Features a visual indicator (e.g., a colored dot) and may use a bolder font weight for the title.
    *   **Read:** Standard font weight and no visual indicator.
    *   **Pressed:** Visual feedback on tap.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Used exclusively on the "Notifications" screen. Tapping an item should navigate the user to the relevant context (e.g., the specific order detail screen).

## Branding & Style Guide

This section defines the core visual identity of the Pharmacy Management System. Adherence to this guide will ensure a consistent, accessible, and professional user interface that builds user trust and reinforces the brand. As per the project requirements, the foundation of our visual style is a **dark Material theme**.

### Visual Identity

*   **Brand Guidelines:** As no formal corporate brand guidelines were provided, this style guide will serve as the foundational visual identity for the application. The aesthetic is clean, modern, and professional, designed to convey trustworthiness and clarity in a healthcare context.

### Color Palette

The color palette is designed for a dark theme, prioritizing accessibility (WCAG AA contrast ratios) and clarity. The primary and accent colors provide a calm yet distinct identity, while the functional colors offer intuitive feedback for user actions.

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary | `#7B8FF7` | Key interactive elements: primary buttons, active tabs, focused inputs. |
| Secondary | `#3A4D9F` | Supporting elements, secondary buttons, and highlights. |
| Accent | `#6DDCCF` | Special highlights, progress indicators, and unique callouts. |
| Success | `#5CB85C` | Positive feedback, confirmations, and success messages. |
| Warning | `#F0AD4E` | Cautions, important notices, and non-critical alerts. |
| Error | `#D9534F` | Error messages, destructive action confirmations, and validation failures. |
| Neutral | `#FFFFFF` | Primary text color for maximum contrast on dark backgrounds. |
| | `#B0B0B0` | Secondary text (e.g., helper text, timestamps). |
| | `#2C2C2E` | Surface color for cards and modals. |
| | `#1C1C1E` | Primary background color of the application. |

### Typography

The typography is selected for maximum readability and a clean, modern aesthetic on mobile screens. We will use a single, versatile font family to maintain consistency.

#### Font Families

*   **Primary & UI:** **Roboto**. As the standard Material Design font, it ensures excellent legibility and a native feel on the Android platform.
*   **Monospace:** **Roboto Mono** (for displaying reference numbers or any fixed-width data).

#### Type Scale

The type scale establishes a clear visual hierarchy for all text content, ensuring users can easily scan and understand information.

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| H1 | 28pt | Bold | 36pt |
| H2 | 24pt | Bold | 32pt |
| H3 | 20pt | Medium | 28pt |
| Body | 16pt | Regular | 24pt |
| Small | 14pt | Regular | 20pt |
| Button | 16pt | Medium | 20pt |

### Iconography

*   **Icon Library:** We will exclusively use the **Material Icons** library. This ensures visual consistency with the Material Design system, provides a comprehensive set of high-quality icons, and simplifies development.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** The default style will be **"Filled"** for maximum clarity and visual weight, especially in the bottom navigation bar. "Outlined" icons may be used for secondary actions where a lighter visual touch is needed. All icons should be used at standard sizes (e.g., 24dp) to maintain consistency.

### Spacing & Layout

*   **Grid System:** All layouts will be based on an **8-point grid system**. This means all spacing and component dimensions will be in multiples of 8 (e.g., 8dp, 16dp, 24dp).
*   **Spacing Scale:** This system provides a consistent rhythm and balance to the UI, making it feel organized and predictable. Common values will be:
    *   **4dp:** Micro-spacing (e.g., between an icon and its text).
    *   **8dp:** Small spacing (e.g., between related elements).
    *   **16dp:** Medium padding and margins (standard content padding within cards).
    *   **24dp:** Large spacing (e.g., between distinct sections on a screen).
    *   **32dp:** Extra-large spacing for significant visual separation.

## Accessibility Requirements

Accessibility is a foundational requirement for this application, not an afterthought. Given the healthcare context, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can manage their prescriptions and health inquiries is a critical measure of success. Our design and development will be guided by the principle of inclusivity.

### Compliance Target

As specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD), the application will adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at a Level AA** conformance. This is the recognized global standard and ensures a robust level of accessibility.

### Key Requirements

To meet our compliance target, the following key requirements must be implemented across the application.

#### Visual

*   **Color Contrast:** All text and essential UI elements must meet or exceed the WCAG AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1 (for normal text) and 3:1 (for large text). The color palette has been designed with this in mind, but all final component designs must be verified.
*   **Focus Indicators:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) must have a clear and highly visible focus indicator when navigated to via keyboard or other assistive technologies.
*   **Text Sizing:** The application must respect the user's system-level font size settings. Text should reflow gracefully without being truncated or overlapping when the font size is increased.

#### Interaction

*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be reachable and operable using a keyboard or equivalent interface. The navigation order must be logical and predictable.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** The application must be fully compatible with Android's **TalkBack** screen reader. This includes providing descriptive labels for all controls, icons, and images.
*   **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target size of 48x48dp to ensure they can be easily and accurately tapped by users with motor impairments.

#### Content

*   **Alternative Text:** While the primary image upload is a prescription (which cannot be fully described by alt text), all meaningful non-text content (like icons that are not purely decorative) must have a text alternative.
*   **Heading Structure:** Screens will use a logical heading structure to allow users of assistive technologies to easily understand the layout and navigate the content.
*   **Form Labels:** Every form input will have a programmatically associated, visible label. Helper text and error messages will also be associated with their respective inputs.

### Testing Strategy

Accessibility will be validated through a combination of automated and manual testing throughout the development lifecycle:

1.  **Automated Testing:** We will integrate accessibility linting tools into the development process to catch common issues early.
2.  **Manual Testing:** Regular manual audits will be performed, including:
    *   Navigating the entire application using only a keyboard.
    *   Testing all user flows with the TalkBack screen reader enabled.
    *   Verifying color contrast with a contrast checker tool.
3.  **User Feedback:** Post-launch, we will provide a clear channel for users to report any accessibility issues they encounter.

### Developer Accessibility Checklist

This checklist is a tactical tool for developers. It should be used during the development of new features and as part of the code review process to ensure compliance with our WCAG AA target.

#### Visual

- [ ] **Contrast:** Have all text and meaningful icon colors been checked against their backgrounds to ensure a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (or 3:1 for large text)?
- [ ] **Focus State:** Is there a clear, visible focus indicator on every interactive element when navigating with a keyboard or D-pad?
- [ ] **Text Scaling:** Does the UI reflow correctly without breaking or truncating content when the device's font size is increased to 200%?

#### Interaction

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigable:** Can every interactive element be reached and activated using only keyboard controls?
- [ ] **Logical Focus Order:** Is the keyboard navigation order logical and predictable, following the visual flow of the screen?
- [ ] **Touch Targets:** Is every tappable element at least 48x48dp in size?
- [ ] **Screen Reader Labels:** Does every control (button, input, checkbox) have a clear, descriptive label that is announced by TalkBack?
- [ ] **Icon-Only Buttons:** Do buttons that only contain an icon have a descriptive text label for screen readers (e.g., a `Semantics` label of "Search" for a magnifying glass icon)?

#### Content & Forms

- [ ] **Headings:** Are screen titles and major section titles marked as headings for screen readers to aid in navigation?
- [ ] **Form Labels:** Is every form input field programmatically associated with a visible text label?
- [ ] **Error Messages:** When a form validation error occurs, is the error message announced to the user and associated with the correct input field?

#### Testing

- [ ] **TalkBack Test:** Have you navigated and operated this feature using TalkBack to ensure the experience is coherent and non-frustrating?
- [ ] **Keyboard-Only Test:** Have you successfully used this feature from start to finish using only a keyboard/D-pad?

## Responsiveness Strategy

While this application is designed exclusively for Android, the platform encompasses a wide variety of screen sizes, densities, and aspect ratios—from compact phones to large tablets. Our responsiveness strategy ensures a consistent, high-quality user experience across all supported devices by adapting the layout to make the best use of the available screen real estate. Our approach is **mobile-first**, meaning we design for the most constrained view first and then progressively enhance the layout for larger screens.

### Breakpoints

We will define two primary breakpoints to guide our layout adaptations. These are based on standard Android density-independent pixel (dp) widths and cover the vast majority of target devices.

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Devices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phone** | 0dp | All standard and compact smartphones. |
| **Tablet** | 600dp | Small to large tablets (e.g., Nexus 7, Pixel Tablet, Samsung Galaxy Tab series). |

### Adaptation Patterns

Our strategy focuses on creating flexible layouts that reflow gracefully rather than creating entirely separate UIs for each breakpoint.

*   **Layout Changes:** The primary adaptation pattern will be reflowing content. For example, a multi-column layout on a tablet will stack into a single, scrollable column on a phone.
    *   **Example (Manager Dashboard):** On a tablet, the KPI cards might be arranged in a 2x2 grid. On a phone, they will stack vertically in a single column.
*   **Navigation Changes:** For the MVP, the bottom tab bar will be used consistently across both phone and tablet layouts to maintain a familiar interaction model. For future, tablet-specific optimizations, we may consider transitioning to a side navigation rail on screens wider than 840dp to make better use of the horizontal space.
*   **Content Priority:** On smaller phone screens, primary content and calls-to-action will always be prioritized and visible "above the fold" where possible. Secondary information or controls may be placed further down in the scroll view.
*   **Interaction Changes:** Touch target sizes (minimum 48x48dp) will be strictly maintained across all breakpoints. The primary change will be the arrangement of content to reduce panning and zooming on larger screens, providing a more comfortable viewing experience.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

In this application, animation is not for decoration; it is a functional tool used to enhance clarity, provide feedback, and build user confidence. Our approach is to use motion to make the interface feel more responsive and intuitive, directly supporting our design principles of "Efficiency is the Feature" and "Provide Constant Reassurance." All animations will be subtle, quick, and purposeful to avoid distracting from the user's primary task.

### Motion Principles

1.  **Functional & Purposeful:** Every animation must have a clear purpose, such as guiding the user's attention, confirming an action, or indicating a change in state. We will avoid purely decorative motion.
2.  **Responsive & Immediate:** The interface must provide immediate feedback for every user interaction. Tapping a button or selecting an item should trigger a subtle but instant visual response, making the app feel fast and reliable.
3.  **Consistent & Predictable:** Animation patterns will be used consistently throughout the application. For example, the transition for navigating to a new screen will always be the same, helping users build a predictable mental model of the app's structure.
4.  **Subtle & Unobtrusive:** Animations will be brief and understated, enhancing the user experience without getting in the way. The goal is to assist, not to distract or cause delays.

### Key Animations

The following are specific, high-impact animations and micro-interactions that will be implemented to improve the user experience.

*   **State Transitions:** Tapping any interactive element (buttons, list items) will trigger a subtle visual feedback, like the Material Design "ripple" effect. This confirms the system has registered the user's touch. (Duration: ~200ms, Easing: Linear)
*   **Screen Navigation:** When navigating deeper into a task (e.g., from the order list to an order detail screen), the new screen will slide in from the right. When returning, it will slide out to the right. This reinforces the hierarchical structure of the app. (Duration: ~300ms, Easing: Decelerate)
*   **Loading Indicators:** For any asynchronous action that takes more than a moment (e.g., uploading a prescription, fetching a list of orders), a clear, non-blocking loading indicator (e.g., a circular progress spinner) will be displayed. This manages user expectations and prevents them from thinking the app is frozen.
*   **Confirmation Feedback:** Upon a successful critical action, like submitting a prescription, the confirmation message and icon (e.g., ✅ "Submission Successful!") will subtly animate in (e.g., a gentle fade-in and scale-up). This provides a moment of positive reinforcement and clearly communicates success. (Duration: ~400ms, Easing: Overshoot)

### Performance & Accessibility Considerations

To ensure our animation strategy enhances the experience for all users without compromising performance or inclusivity, the following requirements must be met.

#### Performance

*   **Risk:** Poorly implemented animations can negatively impact performance on lower-end devices, violating our goal of a "fast and reliable" app.
*   **Mitigation:**
    1.  All animations must be hardware-accelerated to ensure smoothness (standard Flutter animations typically handle this well).
    2.  Any custom animations must be profiled to ensure they maintain a consistent 60 FPS and do not cause frame drops ("jank").
    3.  The "Subtle & Unobtrusive" principle also applies to performance. An animation that causes a noticeable delay must be revised or removed.

#### Accessibility

*   **Risk:** For users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity, animations can be a significant barrier to usability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    1.  To comply with our WCAG AA target, the application **must** respect the system-level "Remove animations" or "Reduce motion" setting in Android's accessibility options.
    2.  When this setting is enabled, all non-essential animations will be disabled or replaced. For example:
        *   Screen transitions will become simple cross-fades instead of slides.
        *   The "Confirmation Feedback" animation will be disabled, with the message appearing instantly.
    3.  Essential feedback animations, such as loading indicators, will remain as they communicate a necessary system state.

## Performance Considerations

Performance is a critical aspect of the user experience. A fast, responsive application feels reliable and professional, building user trust and encouraging adoption. Conversely, a slow or laggy interface undermines our goal of creating an experience that is superior to the manual alternative. This section defines our performance targets and the design strategies we will employ to meet them.

### Performance Goals

To ensure a high-quality user experience, the application will adhere to the following performance benchmarks:

*   **App Startup Time:** The application must launch from a cold start to an interactive state in under **2 seconds**.
*   **Screen Transition Time:** Navigating between screens must feel nearly instantaneous, with transitions completing in under **500ms**.
*   **Interaction Response:** The UI must provide immediate feedback for user input (e.g., a button tap) in under **100ms**.
*   **Animation Smoothness:** All animations and scrolling must maintain a consistent **60 frames per second (FPS)** to avoid "jank" or stuttering, which can make the app feel broken or unprofessional.

### Design Strategies

Our design and development approach will incorporate the following strategies to achieve our performance goals, with a particular focus on providing a graceful and communicative experience even under adverse network conditions.

*   **Image Optimization:** All user-uploaded prescription images will be compressed on the client-side before upload.
    *   **Slow Network UX:** To provide constant reassurance during slow uploads, the UI **must** display a determinate progress bar (e.g., "Uploading... 25%") rather than an indeterminate spinner. This communicates that the app is working, not frozen.
*   **Efficient List Rendering:** All lists in the application (e.g., order history, prescription queue) will be built using virtualized scrolling (`ListView.builder` in Flutter) to ensure smooth performance with large datasets.
    *   **Slow Network UX:** When fetching list data, the UI will display skeleton loaders that mimic the shape of the content. This manages user expectations and feels faster than a blank screen.
*   **Strategic Caching:** We will cache read-only data (like medication search results and notifications).
    *   **Slow Network UX:** This allows the app to display stale data instantly while fetching fresh updates in the background. A subtle indicator (e.g., a "Updating..." message) will inform the user that new data is being loaded without blocking interaction.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** No network requests or database queries will be performed on the main UI thread.
    *   **Slow Network UX:** For any action that initiates a network call (e.g., "Create Order"), the UI **must** provide immediate feedback. The button should enter a disabled/loading state to prevent duplicate taps, and the form should be non-interactive until a server response is received.
