# Performance Considerations

Performance is a critical aspect of the user experience. A fast, responsive application feels reliable and professional, building user trust and encouraging adoption. Conversely, a slow or laggy interface undermines our goal of creating an experience that is superior to the manual alternative. This section defines our performance targets and the design strategies we will employ to meet them.

## Performance Goals

To ensure a high-quality user experience, the application will adhere to the following performance benchmarks:

*   **App Startup Time:** The application must launch from a cold start to an interactive state in under **2 seconds**.
*   **Screen Transition Time:** Navigating between screens must feel nearly instantaneous, with transitions completing in under **500ms**.
*   **Interaction Response:** The UI must provide immediate feedback for user input (e.g., a button tap) in under **100ms**.
*   **Animation Smoothness:** All animations and scrolling must maintain a consistent **60 frames per second (FPS)** to avoid "jank" or stuttering, which can make the app feel broken or unprofessional.

## Design Strategies

Our design and development approach will incorporate the following strategies to achieve our performance goals, with a particular focus on providing a graceful and communicative experience even under adverse network conditions.

*   **Image Optimization:** All user-uploaded prescription images will be compressed on the client-side before upload.
    *   **Slow Network UX:** To provide constant reassurance during slow uploads, the UI **must** display a determinate progress bar (e.g., "Uploading... 25%") rather than an indeterminate spinner. This communicates that the app is working, not frozen.
*   **Efficient List Rendering:** All lists in the application (e.g., order history, prescription queue) will be built using virtualized scrolling (`ListView.builder` in Flutter) to ensure smooth performance with large datasets.
    *   **Slow Network UX:** When fetching list data, the UI will display skeleton loaders that mimic the shape of the content. This manages user expectations and feels faster than a blank screen.
*   **Strategic Caching:** We will cache read-only data (like medication search results and notifications).
    *   **Slow Network UX:** This allows the app to display stale data instantly while fetching fresh updates in the background. A subtle indicator (e.g., a "Updating..." message) will inform the user that new data is being loaded without blocking interaction.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** No network requests or database queries will be performed on the main UI thread.
    *   **Slow Network UX:** For any action that initiates a network call (e.g., "Create Order"), the UI **must** provide immediate feedback. The button should enter a disabled/loading state to prevent duplicate taps, and the form should be non-interactive until a server response is received.
