# Accessibility Requirements

Accessibility is a foundational requirement for this application, not an afterthought. Given the healthcare context, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can manage their prescriptions and health inquiries is a critical measure of success. Our design and development will be guided by the principle of inclusivity.

## Compliance Target

As specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD), the application will adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at a Level AA** conformance. This is the recognized global standard and ensures a robust level of accessibility.

## Key Requirements

To meet our compliance target, the following key requirements must be implemented across the application.

### Visual

*   **Color Contrast:** All text and essential UI elements must meet or exceed the WCAG AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1 (for normal text) and 3:1 (for large text). The color palette has been designed with this in mind, but all final component designs must be verified.
*   **Focus Indicators:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) must have a clear and highly visible focus indicator when navigated to via keyboard or other assistive technologies.
*   **Text Sizing:** The application must respect the user's system-level font size settings. Text should reflow gracefully without being truncated or overlapping when the font size is increased.

### Interaction

*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be reachable and operable using a keyboard or equivalent interface. The navigation order must be logical and predictable.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** The application must be fully compatible with Android's **TalkBack** screen reader. This includes providing descriptive labels for all controls, icons, and images.
*   **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target size of 48x48dp to ensure they can be easily and accurately tapped by users with motor impairments.

### Content

*   **Alternative Text:** While the primary image upload is a prescription (which cannot be fully described by alt text), all meaningful non-text content (like icons that are not purely decorative) must have a text alternative.
*   **Heading Structure:** Screens will use a logical heading structure to allow users of assistive technologies to easily understand the layout and navigate the content.
*   **Form Labels:** Every form input will have a programmatically associated, visible label. Helper text and error messages will also be associated with their respective inputs.

## Testing Strategy

Accessibility will be validated through a combination of automated and manual testing throughout the development lifecycle:

1.  **Automated Testing:** We will integrate accessibility linting tools into the development process to catch common issues early.
2.  **Manual Testing:** Regular manual audits will be performed, including:
    *   Navigating the entire application using only a keyboard.
    *   Testing all user flows with the TalkBack screen reader enabled.
    *   Verifying color contrast with a contrast checker tool.
3.  **User Feedback:** Post-launch, we will provide a clear channel for users to report any accessibility issues they encounter.

## Developer Accessibility Checklist

This checklist is a tactical tool for developers. It should be used during the development of new features and as part of the code review process to ensure compliance with our WCAG AA target.

### Visual

- [ ] **Contrast:** Have all text and meaningful icon colors been checked against their backgrounds to ensure a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (or 3:1 for large text)?
- [ ] **Focus State:** Is there a clear, visible focus indicator on every interactive element when navigating with a keyboard or D-pad?
- [ ] **Text Scaling:** Does the UI reflow correctly without breaking or truncating content when the device's font size is increased to 200%?

### Interaction

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigable:** Can every interactive element be reached and activated using only keyboard controls?
- [ ] **Logical Focus Order:** Is the keyboard navigation order logical and predictable, following the visual flow of the screen?
- [ ] **Touch Targets:** Is every tappable element at least 48x48dp in size?
- [ ] **Screen Reader Labels:** Does every control (button, input, checkbox) have a clear, descriptive label that is announced by TalkBack?
- [ ] **Icon-Only Buttons:** Do buttons that only contain an icon have a descriptive text label for screen readers (e.g., a `Semantics` label of "Search" for a magnifying glass icon)?

### Content & Forms

- [ ] **Headings:** Are screen titles and major section titles marked as headings for screen readers to aid in navigation?
- [ ] **Form Labels:** Is every form input field programmatically associated with a visible text label?
- [ ] **Error Messages:** When a form validation error occurs, is the error message announced to the user and associated with the correct input field?

### Testing

- [ ] **TalkBack Test:** Have you navigated and operated this feature using TalkBack to ensure the experience is coherent and non-frustrating?
- [ ] **Keyboard-Only Test:** Have you successfully used this feature from start to finish using only a keyboard/D-pad?
