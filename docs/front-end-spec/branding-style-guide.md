# Branding & Style Guide

This section defines the core visual identity of the Pharmacy Management System. Adherence to this guide will ensure a consistent, accessible, and professional user interface that builds user trust and reinforces the brand. As per the project requirements, the foundation of our visual style is a **dark Material theme**.

## Visual Identity

*   **Brand Guidelines:** As no formal corporate brand guidelines were provided, this style guide will serve as the foundational visual identity for the application. The aesthetic is clean, modern, and professional, designed to convey trustworthiness and clarity in a healthcare context.

## Color Palette

The color palette is designed for a dark theme, prioritizing accessibility (WCAG AA contrast ratios) and clarity. The primary and accent colors provide a calm yet distinct identity, while the functional colors offer intuitive feedback for user actions.

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary | `#7B8FF7` | Key interactive elements: primary buttons, active tabs, focused inputs. |
| Secondary | `#3A4D9F` | Supporting elements, secondary buttons, and highlights. |
| Accent | `#6DDCCF` | Special highlights, progress indicators, and unique callouts. |
| Success | `#5CB85C` | Positive feedback, confirmations, and success messages. |
| Warning | `#F0AD4E` | Cautions, important notices, and non-critical alerts. |
| Error | `#D9534F` | Error messages, destructive action confirmations, and validation failures. |
| Neutral | `#FFFFFF` | Primary text color for maximum contrast on dark backgrounds. |
| | `#B0B0B0` | Secondary text (e.g., helper text, timestamps). |
| | `#2C2C2E` | Surface color for cards and modals. |
| | `#1C1C1E` | Primary background color of the application. |

## Typography

The typography is selected for maximum readability and a clean, modern aesthetic on mobile screens. We will use a single, versatile font family to maintain consistency.

### Font Families

*   **Primary & UI:** **Roboto**. As the standard Material Design font, it ensures excellent legibility and a native feel on the Android platform.
*   **Monospace:** **Roboto Mono** (for displaying reference numbers or any fixed-width data).

### Type Scale

The type scale establishes a clear visual hierarchy for all text content, ensuring users can easily scan and understand information.

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| H1 | 28pt | Bold | 36pt |
| H2 | 24pt | Bold | 32pt |
| H3 | 20pt | Medium | 28pt |
| Body | 16pt | Regular | 24pt |
| Small | 14pt | Regular | 20pt |
| Button | 16pt | Medium | 20pt |

## Iconography

*   **Icon Library:** We will exclusively use the **Material Icons** library. This ensures visual consistency with the Material Design system, provides a comprehensive set of high-quality icons, and simplifies development.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** The default style will be **"Filled"** for maximum clarity and visual weight, especially in the bottom navigation bar. "Outlined" icons may be used for secondary actions where a lighter visual touch is needed. All icons should be used at standard sizes (e.g., 24dp) to maintain consistency.

## Spacing & Layout

*   **Grid System:** All layouts will be based on an **8-point grid system**. This means all spacing and component dimensions will be in multiples of 8 (e.g., 8dp, 16dp, 24dp).
*   **Spacing Scale:** This system provides a consistent rhythm and balance to the UI, making it feel organized and predictable. Common values will be:
    *   **4dp:** Micro-spacing (e.g., between an icon and its text).
    *   **8dp:** Small spacing (e.g., between related elements).
    *   **16dp:** Medium padding and margins (standard content padding within cards).
    *   **24dp:** Large spacing (e.g., between distinct sections on a screen).
    *   **32dp:** Extra-large spacing for significant visual separation.
