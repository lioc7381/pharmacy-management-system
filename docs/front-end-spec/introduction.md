# Introduction

<!--docs/front-end-spec/[title].md-->

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Pharmacy Management System's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and functional experience built upon a simplified, maintainable architecture.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

*   **The Client:** An individual seeking a modern, convenient, and reliable way to manage their prescriptions. They value their time and expect a straightforward digital experience.
*   **Internal Staff (Sales, Delivery, Pharmacist):** Skilled professionals who need a unified, role-specific digital tool that provides a single source of truth and streamlines their core tasks.
*   **The Manager:** A decision-maker who needs a clear interface for viewing inventory, sales, and staff activity to make informed business decisions.

### Usability Goals

*   **Efficiency:** Core tasks (e.g., a client submitting a prescription, a salesperson processing an order) must be demonstrably faster and require fewer steps than the current manual alternatives.
*   **Clarity & Predictability:** When online, users must have a clear understanding of their tasks and the system's state. The interface will behave predictably, ensuring that actions have consistent outcomes.
*   **Clear Error Resolution:** The design will not attempt to prevent all possible user errors on the client side. Instead, it will provide clear, direct feedback from the server when an error occurs (e.g., an invalid file upload) and guide the user on how to resolve it.
*   **Learnability:** New users, both clients and staff, should be able to successfully complete their primary tasks with minimal to no training, guided by an intuitive and uncluttered interface.

### Design Principles

1.  **Clarity Above All:** Every interface must be unambiguous and easy to understand. We will prioritize clear communication and straightforward functionality over complex features.
2.  **Simplicity is the Feature:** The primary goal is to reduce complexity. Workflows will be optimized to be direct and to the point. The application will be lean, fast, and focused exclusively on its core online capabilities.
3.  **Direct and Honest Feedback:** The system will communicate its status based on direct interaction with the server. Users receive feedback through confirmation messages after successful actions or clear error messages after failed ones. Connectivity issues are handled by notifying the user when an action cannot be completed, with an option to retry.
4.  **Role-Focused Design:** Each user role has a different job to do. Their interface will be tailored to their specific needs, hiding irrelevant information and complexity to create a focused and powerful tool for their tasks.
