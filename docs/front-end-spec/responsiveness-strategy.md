# Responsiveness Strategy

<!--docs/front-end-spec/[title].md-->

While this application is designed exclusively for Android, the platform encompasses a wide variety of screen sizes, densities, and aspect ratiosâ€”from compact phones to large tablets. Our responsiveness strategy ensures a consistent, high-quality user experience across all supported devices by adapting the layout to make the best use of the available screen real estate. Our approach is **mobile-first**, meaning we design for the most constrained view first and then progressively enhance the layout for larger screens.

## Breakpoints

We will define two primary breakpoints to guide our layout adaptations. These are based on standard Android density-independent pixel (dp) widths and cover the vast majority of target devices.

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Devices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phone** | 0dp | All standard and compact smartphones. |
| **Tablet** | 600dp | Small to large tablets (e.g., Nexus 7, Pixel Tablet, Samsung Galaxy Tab series). |

## Adaptation Patterns

Our strategy focuses on creating flexible layouts that reflow gracefully rather than creating entirely separate UIs for each breakpoint.

*   **Layout Changes:** The primary adaptation pattern will be reflowing content. For example, a multi-column layout on a tablet will stack into a single, scrollable column on a phone.
    *   **Example (Manager Dashboard):** On a tablet, the KPI cards might be arranged in a 2x2 grid. On a phone, they will stack vertically in a single column.
*   **Navigation Changes:** For the MVP, the bottom tab bar will be used consistently across both phone and tablet layouts to maintain a familiar interaction model. For future, tablet-specific optimizations, we may consider transitioning to a side navigation rail on screens wider than 840dp to make better use of the horizontal space.
*   **Content Priority:** On smaller phone screens, primary content and calls-to-action will always be prioritized and visible "above the fold" where possible. Secondary information or controls may be placed further down in the scroll view.
*   **Interaction Changes:** Touch target sizes (minimum 48x48dp) will be strictly maintained across all breakpoints. The primary change will be the arrangement of content to reduce panning and zooming on larger screens, providing a more comfortable viewing experience.
