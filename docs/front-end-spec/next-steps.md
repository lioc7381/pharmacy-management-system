# Next Steps

With the completion of this UI/UX Specification, we have a comprehensive blueprint for the application's design and user experience. This document serves as the single source of truth for all frontend design and development decisions. The following steps outline the immediate actions required to transition from specification to implementation.

## Immediate Actions

1.  **Stakeholder Review & Approval:** This document should be circulated to all key stakeholders (Product Management, Lead Development) for a final review and formal approval. This ensures complete alignment before any high-fidelity design or coding begins.
2.  **Finalize Screen Specifications:** Review the screen layouts detailed in the `Wireframes & Mockups` section to ensure they provide sufficient detail for development. This document is the sole source of truth for the UI and no separate visual mockups will be created.
3.  **Handoff to Frontend Architecture:** Once this specification is approved, it will be formally handed off to the development team to begin creating the frontend architecture and planning the component implementation.
4.  **Resolve Open Questions:** Address the two minor open questions inherited from the Project Brief regarding "weak password criteria" and "Terms of Use content" to ensure the registration flow can be fully implemented without ambiguity.
