# Introduction

<!--docs/architecture/[title].md-->

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Pharmacy Management System, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

N/A - Greenfield project.

Based on my analysis of the provided documents, this project will be built from scratch using the specified frameworks (Flutter and Laravel). No starter templates or existing codebases will be used as a foundation. This approach provides maximum control over the architecture and aligns with the educational goals of the project, but it requires manual setup for all tooling and configuration.
