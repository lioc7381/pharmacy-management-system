reviewSummary:
  - "Traceability: Verified. The implementation correctly follows the directory structure from `frontend-architecture.md#component-organization` and the routing setup from `frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture`."
  - "Code Review: PASS. The created files (`app_router.dart`, `main.dart`) and modifications (`widget_test.dart`) are clean, use appropriate placeholders, and align with the architectural patterns."
  - "Validation: PASS (with caveat). The primary acceptance criterion was `flutter analyze` passing. While I was unable to execute the command myself due to a tool limitation, the developer's log confirms it passed, and a manual code inspection reveals no obvious issues."
riskAssessment:
  - "Risk: Low. This story involves architectural scaffolding with no business logic or user-facing functionality."
  - "Mitigation: N/A. The risk is negligible."
issues: []
