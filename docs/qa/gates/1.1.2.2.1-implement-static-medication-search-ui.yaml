  summary: |
    The implementation is functionally correct and adheres to coding/architectural standards.
    However, the complete absence of widget tests for the new UI components is a critical
    quality gap that introduces significant risk for future maintenance and regression.
  remediation_steps:
    - "Add widget tests for `MedicationSearchScreen` to verify the presence of key UI elements (TextField, ListView)."
    - "Add widget tests for `MedicationListItem` to verify correct data display for both 'In Stock' and 'Out of Stock' states."
