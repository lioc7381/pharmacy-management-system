# Risk Profile: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-08-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 66/100

This foundational story has a high-risk profile due to the sheer volume of initial setup, configuration, and inter-dependency between the frontend and backend. Precision and adherence to architectural documents are critical to mitigate these risks.

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Incorrect Monorepo Setup
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The architectural documents are detailed, but manual setup of a complex structure is prone to human error.
**Impact**: High - Deviations will cause cascading inconsistencies, complicating future development, CI/CD automation, and developer onboarding.
**Mitigation**:
- The developer must perform a line-by-line comparison of the created project structure against `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.
- **Testing Focus**: Manually verify all folder and file names in both `frontend` and `backend` directories against the specification.

### 2. [TECH-002]: Dependency Version Mismatch
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - `composer` and `pub` will pull compatible versions, but they may not be the *exact* versions specified.
**Impact**: High - Mismatched versions can lead to subtle bugs, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities that are difficult to trace later.
**Mitigation**:
- The developer must verify that the final locked versions in `composer.lock` and `pubspec.lock` align with the project's `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`.
- **Testing Focus**: Successful execution of all dependency installation commands and subsequent application startup.

### 3. [SEC-001]: Insecure Sanctum Configuration
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The `install:api` command is standard, but the instruction to apply recommendations from terminal output introduces a manual, variable step that could be missed or misinterpreted.
**Impact**: High - Improper configuration could fail to protect API endpoints, exposing the application to unauthorized access from day one.
**Mitigation**:
- The developer must document exactly which post-installation recommendations were applied.
- The resulting configuration in `config/auth.php` and middleware setup must be reviewed against Sanctum's official documentation for token-based authentication.
- **Testing Focus**: Create a temporary authenticated test route and verify it is properly protected by Sanctum's guard, returning a 401/403 error for unauthenticated requests.

### 4. [OPS-001]: Incomplete/Inaccurate README
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - It is very common for documentation to have minor errors or miss implicit steps that the original author takes for granted.
**Impact**: Medium - An inaccurate README will immediately block other developers and CI/CD pipelines from being able to build and run the project, but it is easily correctable once discovered.
**Mitigation**:
- **"Clean Slate" Test**: After writing the instructions, the developer MUST clone the repository to a fresh directory and follow only the steps in the `README.md` to ensure it produces a working environment from scratch.
- **Testing Focus**: End-to-end validation of the `README.md` setup guide.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TECH-001 | Incorrect Monorepo Setup | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Manual comparison with architecture docs. |
| TECH-002 | Dependency Version Mismatch | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Verify locked versions against tech stack doc. |
| SEC-001 | Insecure Sanctum Configuration | Security | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Document applied steps; review against official docs. |
| OPS-001 | Incomplete/Inaccurate README | Operational | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High | Perform a "clean slate" test from the README. |
| DATA-001 | Flawed DB Migrations/Seeding | Data | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Manually inspect DB after migration; write feature test for seeded data. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **README Validation**: Execute a full project setup from a clean clone using *only* the `README.md` file.
- **Security Test**: Add a temporary, authenticated-only API endpoint and write a feature test to confirm it is properly firewalled by Sanctum.
- **Structure Verification**: Manually audit the created directory and file structure against `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.
- **Dependency Audit**: Manually check `composer.lock` and `pubspec.lock` against `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **Database Seeder Test**: Write a feature test that runs after the seeder and asserts that the expected user roles and sample medications exist in the database.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Review
- All High-risk (score 6) items must have their mitigation strategies fully implemented and verified.
- The "Clean Slate" test for the `README.md` must pass.
