Title: Implement Health Check Vertical Slice
---

# Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to implement a basic health-check feature connecting the Flutter app to the Laravel API,
**so that** I can verify the communication channel between the frontend and backend is working correctly.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. A public health-check endpoint (`GET /api/health`) is created in the Laravel application that returns a `200 OK` status with a simple JSON response (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`).
2. A basic feature test for the `GET /api/health` endpoint exists and passes, verifying the `200 OK` status.
3. The Flutter app contains a simple `ApiClientService` using the `dio` package for HTTP requests.
4. The Flutter app has a basic health check screen with a button that calls the `/api/health` endpoint and displays the result.
5. The health check feature is accessible via the existing `go_router` setup from story 1.1.2.

# Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Backend API Endpoint (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [x] Create a simple `HealthCheckController.php` in `backend/app/Http/Controllers/`
  - [x] Register the `GET /api/health` route in `backend/routes/api.php`
  - [x] Write a basic feature test in `backend/tests/Feature/HealthCheckTest.php`

- [x] **Frontend API Service (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Create a basic `ApiClientService` in `frontend/lib/core/api/api_client_service.dart`

- [x] **Frontend UI & Integration (AC: 4, 5)**
  - [x] Create `frontend/lib/features/health_check/` folder structure
  - [x] Create a simple health check screen with a button
  - [x] Display API response or error message directly in the UI
  - [x] Add health check route to the existing `go_router` configuration
  - [x] Create a basic navigation from main screen to health check

# Dev Notes

- **Simplicity Focus:** This story prioritizes getting a working end-to-end connection over complex patterns
- **Backend Health Check:** Simple controller that returns `{"status": "ok"}` - no business logic needed
- **Frontend API Client:** Basic HTTP client using `dio` - minimal configuration
- **Frontend UI:** Simple screen with button and text display - no complex state management required
- **Routing Integration:** Leverage the existing `go_router` setup from story 1.1.2
- **File Structure:** Follow the directory structure established in story 1.1.2

## Testing

- **Backend:** Simple feature test to verify endpoint returns 200 status
- **Frontend:** Basic widget test to verify button renders (no mocking required)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is clean, straightforward, and effectively meets all acceptance criteria. The previous review finding regarding the missing UI navigation has been successfully addressed by adding buttons to the `LoginScreen` and `DashboardScreen`, making the health check feature accessible. The code follows established conventions for both Laravel and Flutter.

### Refactoring Performed

None. No refactoring was necessary as the code is clear and fit for purpose.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Adheres to standard practices for both frameworks.
- Project Structure: [✓] Follows the established directory structure.
- Testing Strategy: [✓] The backend feature test is appropriate and passes.
- All ACs Met: [✓] All five acceptance criteria have been successfully validated.

### Improvements Checklist

While not required for this story, the following is a recommendation for future sprints to improve maintainability:

- [ ] Consider abstracting the base URL in `ApiClientService` into a configuration file (e.g., using `.env`) to avoid hardcoding and support different environments (dev, staging, prod).

### Security Review

Not applicable. The endpoint is public and exposes no sensitive information.

### Performance Considerations

Not applicable. The feature has a negligible performance impact.

### Files Modified During Review

None.
