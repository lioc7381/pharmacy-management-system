Status: Draft
Epic: 1
Story: 1.1.2
Title: Implement Frontend Structure and Routing
---

### Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** the existing Flutter project to be structured according to the defined architecture, including the feature-based folder layout from [`frontend-architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md) and initial routing using `go_router`,
**so that** I have a scalable and organized frontend foundation.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The Flutter application's `lib` directory is organized with the feature-based folder structure specified in the [`frontend-architecture.md#component-organization`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization) document.
2.  A basic `go_router` setup is implemented as described in the [`frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture) section, ready for future route additions.
3.  The project passes all `flutter analyze` checks without errors or warnings, adhering to the linting rules defined in [`tech-stack.md`](../../docs/architecture/tech-stack.md).

### Tasks / Subtasks

-   **Implement Directory & Routing Structure (AC: 1, 2)**
    -   [ ] Delete the default `main.dart` content.
    -   [ ] Create the specified feature-based directory structure inside `frontend/lib/` as detailed in [`frontend-architecture.md#component-organization`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization).
    -   [ ] Add `go_router` to `pubspec.yaml` using the version specified in [`tech-stack.md`](../../docs/architecture/tech-stack.md) and run `flutter pub get`.
    -   [ ] Implement a basic `GoRouter` configuration in a new `lib/core/navigation/app_router.dart` file, following the pattern in [`frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture).
    -   [ ] Create a minimal `main.dart` that initializes the app and the router.
-   **Validation (AC: 3)**
    -   [ ] Run `flutter analyze` to ensure the new structure is clean.

### Dev Notes

*   **Prerequisite:** A default Flutter project has already been created in the `frontend` directory at the root of the monorepo.
*   **Technology Stack:** The specific version of Flutter and key packages like `go_router` are definitively listed in [`docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`](../../docs/architecture/tech-stack.md).
*   **Folder Structure:** The `lib` directory must be organized by feature as laid out in [`docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization). This includes creating core directories like `api`, `navigation`, `security`, `db`, and `models`, as well as an initial `features` directory.
*   **Routing:** A basic `go_router` setup should be implemented as per the [`docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture) document. This will involve creating the `app_router.dart` file with a single, simple route (e.g., for a login or home screen placeholder).

#### Testing

Formal testing (Unit, Widget, Integration) is not applicable to this story.

**Rationale:** The tasks in this story are limited to architectural scaffolding, such as creating the directory structure and implementing boilerplate for the routing configuration. These actions do not introduce testable business logic, UI components, or user flows.

The primary validation for this foundational work is covered by **Acceptance Criterion #3**, which requires the project to pass `flutter analyze` without any issues. This ensures the code is syntactically correct and adheres to the project's defined coding standards.

Specific tests will be created in subsequent stories when features, widgets, and state management logic are implemented, in accordance with the `## Testing Strategy` section of the architecture document.
