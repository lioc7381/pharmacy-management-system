Title: Implement Static Medication Search UI
Parent: 1.2
---

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a static UI for the medication search screen with placeholder components,
**so that** the visual layout can be implemented and reviewed before adding business logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new feature module directory `lib/features/medication_search/` is created, following the project's frontend architecture.
2.  A new screen file `lib/features/medication_search/screens/medication_search_screen.dart` is created.
3.  The `MedicationSearchScreen` widget contains a `TextField` for user input and a `ListView` to display results.
4.  A reusable widget `lib/features/medication_search/widgets/medication_list_item.dart` is created to display a single medication's details (name, price, and stock status) using hardcoded or dummy data for now.
5.  The screen is navigable within the app for review purposes.
6.  All new public classes and methods have DartDoc comments as mandated by [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`](../../docs/architecture/coding-standards.md).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Frontend: Create Feature Directory Structure**
  - [x] Create `lib/features/medication_search/` with subdirectories for `screens`, `widgets`, `providers`, and `services`.
- [x] **Frontend: Create Search Screen Widget**
  - [x] Create the `MedicationSearchScreen` stateful or stateless widget in `lib/features/medication_search/screens/medication_search_screen.dart`.
  - [x] Add a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a body containing a `Column`.
  - [x] Add a `TextField` for search input at the top of the body.
  - [x] Add an `Expanded` `ListView` below the text field.
- [x] **Frontend: Create Medication List Item Widget**
  - [x] Create the `MedicationListItem` widget in `lib/features/medication_search/widgets/medication_list_item.dart`.
  - [x] The widget should accept a `Medication` object and display its `name`, `price`, and `isInStock` status ("In Stock" / "Out of Stock").
  - [x] Populate the `ListView` in `MedicationSearchScreen` with a few `MedicationListItem` widgets using hardcoded `Medication` model instances to verify the layout.

## Dev Agent Record

### Completion Notes

- Implemented the static UI for the medication search screen as per the requirements.
- Created the necessary directory structure, widgets, and a model for `Medication`.
- The screen is now the main entry point of the app for easy review.
- No tests were created as it was not specified in the story.

### File List

- `frontend/lib/features/medication_search/models/medication.dart`
- `frontend/lib/features/medication_search/screens/medication_search_screen.dart`
- `frontend/lib/features/medication_search/widgets/medication_list_item.dart`
- `frontend/lib/main.dart` (modified)

### Change Log

- **2025-09-05**: Implemented static UI for medication search.

## Architectural Compliance

- **Coding Standards**: All code must adhere to the naming conventions and mandatory documentation defined in [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`](../../docs/architecture/coding-standards.md).
- **Frontend Architecture**: The file and directory structure must conform to the guidelines in [`docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md).

## QA Results

**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Date**: 2025-09-05
**Decision**: **CONCERNS**

### Summary

The implementation correctly delivers the static UI for the medication search screen, adhering to all documented coding and architectural standards. All acceptance criteria related to UI and code structure have been met. However, the complete absence of automated tests presents a significant quality risk, leading to a "CONCERNS" decision.

### Key Findings

-   ✅ **Requirements Met**: All functional aspects of the story are implemented as specified.
-   ✅ **Architectural Compliance**: The code structure aligns with the established `frontend-architecture.md`.
-   ✅ **Documentation**: All new public classes and methods are properly documented with DartDoc comments as required by `coding-standards.md`.
-   ❌ **Critical Testing Gap**: No widget tests were created for the new UI components. This introduces a high risk of future regressions and increases long-term maintenance costs.

### Recommendations for Remediation

1.  **Add Widget Tests**: Create a new test file `frontend/test/features/medication_search/medication_search_screen_test.dart`.
2.  **Test `MedicationSearchScreen`**: Add a test to verify that the `MedicationSearchScreen` renders a `TextField` and a `ListView`.
3.  **Test `MedicationListItem`**: Add tests to verify that the `MedicationListItem` correctly displays the medication name, price, and stock status (both "In Stock" and "Out of Stock" states).

**Conclusion**: The work is of high quality from a code and structure perspective but is incomplete without a foundational layer of testing. The "CONCERNS" can be addressed by implementing the recommended widget tests.
