Story: 1.1.4
Title: Implement Database Seeding
---


## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to create a database seeder for the Laravel application,
**so that** the system can be populated with consistent sample data for immediate testing and demonstration.

This story is a foundational step in making the backend, defined in the [`backend-architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md), testable. It involves creating the necessary Eloquent models, factories, and seeders as laid out in the [`unified-project-structure.md`](../../docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Laravel database seeder classes are implemented in the `backend/database/seeders/` directory.
2. When run, the seeder populates the `users` table with at least one user for each role (`client`, `pharmacist`, `salesperson`, `delivery`, `manager`) as defined in the [`database-schema.md`](../../docs/architecture/database-schema.md).
3. When run, the seeder populates the `medications` table with a small catalog of sample medications, conforming to the schema in [`database-schema.md`](../../docs/architecture/database-schema.md).
4. The main `backend/database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` is configured to call the individual seeders for users and medications.
5. The command `php artisan migrate --seed`, as specified in the [`development-workflow.md`](../../docs/architecture/development-workflow.md), successfully runs the migrations and then the seeders without errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Create Eloquent Models (Prerequisite)**
  - [x] Modify the existing `backend/app/Models/User.php` model to correspond with the `users` table migration. The model's structure should align with the definition in [`data-models.md`](../../docs/architecture/data-models.md).
  - [x] Create the `backend/app/Models/Medication.php` model to correspond with the `medications` table migration. Ensure it has the `HasFactory` trait and appropriate `$fillable` properties as detailed in [`data-models.md`](../../docs/architecture/data-models.md).
- [x] **Implement Model Factories (AC: #2, #3)**
  - [x] Modify the existing `backend/database/factories/UserFactory.php` to support creating users with specific roles (e.g., 'client', 'pharmacist', 'manager').
  - [x] Create `backend/database/factories/MedicationFactory.php` and configure it to generate sample medication data, using the newly created `Medication` model.
- [x] **Implement Seeder Classes (AC: #1, #2, #3)**
  - [x] Create `backend/database/seeders/UserSeeder.php` that uses the `UserFactory` to create at least one user for each role.
  - [x] Create `backend/database/seeders/MedicationSeeder.php` that uses the `MedicationFactory` to create 10-15 sample medications.
- [x] **Configure and Validate (AC: #4, #5)**
  - [x] Modify `backend/database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` to call the `UserSeeder` and `MedicationSeeder`, replacing the current hardcoded "Test User" creation.
  - [x] Run `php artisan db:wipe` to clear the database.
  - [x] Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to verify that the entire process works flawlessly.

## Dev Notes

- **Model Preparation for Factories:** 
- *User Model* 
  The existing `User` model needs to be updated before its factory can be created. For this story, it is sufficient to define a basic model class that includes the `HasFactory` trait and specifies `$fillable` attributes that align with the migration detailed in [`database-schema.md`](../../docs/architecture/database-schema.md).
- *Medication Model*
  The `Medication` model must be created prior to implementing its factory. Similar to the `User` model, the initial version only needs to include the `HasFactory` trait and `$fillable` attributes that reflect the migration. The full model definition can be found in [`data-models.md`](../../docs/architecture/data-models.md).
- **Seeder:** The database seeder is critical for creating a testable initial state. It must create users for all roles and several sample `Medication` records.
- **Data Models:** The structure for the sample data should conform to the `User` and newly created `Medication` data models. The `users` migration defines the roles: `client`, `pharmacist`, `salesperson`, `delivery`, `manager`.
- **Factories:** It is highly recommended to use Laravel's model factories to generate the sample data in a clean and repeatable way. All PHP code should adhere to the project's [`coding-standards.md`](../../docs/architecture/coding-standards.md).
- **Tech Stack:** This implementation will leverage the seeding and factory features of the Laravel framework, which is the designated backend technology as per [`docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`](../../docs/architecture/tech-stack.md).

### Testing

Validation will be performed by running `php artisan db:wipe` followed by `php artisan migrate --seed` to ensure the entire process executes without errors and populates the database as expected.

### Debug Log References

*No references provided.*

### Completion Notes List

- Added PHPDoc blocks to the `Medication` model and the `UserSeeder`, `MedicationSeeder` classes to comply with coding standards.
- Created a dedicated feature test `DatabaseSeedingTest` to automatically verify that the database seeding process works correctly and meets all acceptance criteria.
- Ran the test suite to confirm that the new test passes and that no existing functionality is broken.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation quality is excellent. The developer has successfully addressed all points from the previous review, elevating the solution from functional to robust. The addition of the `DatabaseSeedingTest` feature test provides a crucial automated safeguard against future regressions and perfectly validates the acceptance criteria. The code remains clean, well-documented, and adheres to project standards.

### Refactoring Performed

None required. The code quality is high, and all previous concerns were addressed by the developer.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] PHPDoc blocks have been added to the new models and seeders, resolving the previous concern.
- Project Structure: [✓] All files remain in their correct locations.
- Testing Strategy: [✓] The addition of an automated feature test (`DatabaseSeedingTest`) fully satisfies the project's testing strategy for this functionality.
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria are met and are now automatically verified by the new test.

### Improvements Checklist

The following items from the previous review have been successfully addressed:

- [x] **Actionable:** Add PHPDoc blocks to the `Medication` model and all new seeder classes.
- [x] **Recommendation:** Create a dedicated feature or unit test that runs the migrations and seeders, and then asserts that the database contains the expected data.

No further improvements are required for this story.
