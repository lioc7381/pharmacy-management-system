# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Provide customers with a convenient, transparent, and reliable digital channel to manage their prescriptions and health inquiries.
*   Increase operational efficiency by reducing the manual effort required to process prescriptions from submission to delivery.
*   Improve inventory management to minimize revenue loss from stockouts and reduce capital waste from overstocking.
*   Enhance customer retention and loyalty by delivering a modern, high-quality digital experience.
*   Protect pharmacists' clinical focus by creating a structured, asynchronous system for managing patient questions, thereby reducing administrative interruptions.

## Background Context

The pharmacy's current reliance on manual, disconnected workflows creates significant friction for both customers and internal staff. Customers face an inconvenient and opaque process for managing prescriptions, requiring physical visits or phone calls for routine tasks. This results in a poor user experience that fails to meet modern expectations for digital convenience.

Internally, the lack of a unified digital system leads to operational inefficiencies, a high risk of human error, and a lack of real-time data for management. This project is a strategic imperative to build a foundational digital platform that will streamline operations, empower customers with self-service tools, and provide the data visibility needed for effective business management, ensuring the pharmacy's long-term viability and ability to innovate.
