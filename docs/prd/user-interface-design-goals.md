# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience must be modern, intuitive, and efficient, directly contrasting the high-friction manual processes it replaces. The design should inspire confidence and trust, ensuring that both customers and staff perceive the application as a reliable and streamlined tool. Key principles are clarity, simplicity, and speed, minimizing the number of steps required to complete core tasks like submitting a prescription or processing an order.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The application will adhere to standard mobile interaction patterns familiar to Android users. This includes taps, swipes, and scrolling for navigation, along with standard form inputs for data entry. A key interaction will be the image selection and upload workflow for prescriptions, which must be seamless and straightforward.

## Primary Navigation

To ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience, the application will use a **Bottom Navigation Bar** for primary navigation on the main authenticated screens. The navigation bar will be visible to all authenticated user roles but will display different tabs based on the user's role.

*   **Client Role:**
    *   Dashboard / Home
    *   Submit Prescription
    *   My Orders
    *   Notifications
*   **Staff Roles (Salesperson, Delivery, etc.):**
    *   Dashboard / Queue
    *   Order Management
    *   Notifications
*   **Manager Role:**
    *   Dashboard
    *   Management (leading to sub-screens for Client, Staff, and Medication management)
    *   Notifications

Secondary navigation (e.g., navigating from a list to a detail view) will be handled through standard screen-to-screen transitions.

## Responsive Design

While the application is "Mobile Only (Android)", it must be responsive enough to provide a usable experience across a range of screen sizes, from small phones to larger tablets in portrait orientation.

*   **Layouts:** Use fluid layouts (e.g., Flutter's `Expanded` and `Flexible` widgets) that adapt to the available width. Avoid fixed-width elements.
*   **Breakpoints:** While a complex breakpoint system is not required for the MVP, the UI should not break or have overflow errors on common device widths (e.g., 360dp to 800dp).
*   **Text:** Text should wrap correctly and remain legible on all screen sizes.
*   **Orientation:** The application should be locked to **portrait mode** to simplify the responsive design effort for the MVP.

## Core Screens and Views

This is a conceptual list of the essential screens required to deliver the MVP functionality, intended to guide the Design Architect:

*   Login / Registration Screen
*   Public Medication Search Screen
*   Client Dashboard (Main authenticated screen for clients)
*   Prescription Submission Form (including image selection)
*   Order History / Status List (for clients)
*   Staff Dashboard (Role-specific view for authenticated staff)
*   Prescription Processing Queue (for staff)
*   Order Management View (for staff)
*   Notification Center
*   Client Management Screen (for searching, viewing, and editing clients)
*   Staff Management Screen (for adding, viewing, and editing employees)
*   Medication Management Screen (for adding, viewing, and editing medications)

## Accessibility

Accessibility: WCAG AA

## Branding

The application will use a clean, mobile-first, dark Material theme. No specific corporate branding elements (logos, color palettes) have been provided at this stage.

## Target Device and Platforms

Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only (Android)
