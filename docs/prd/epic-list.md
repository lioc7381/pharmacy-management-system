# Epic List

This section outlines the high-level epics required to deliver the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The epics are structured to be logically sequential, with each one delivering a significant, end-to-end increment of testable functionality. This structure allows for iterative development, starting with the foundational infrastructure and progressively building out the core user journeys for each role.

*   **Epic 1: Foundation, User Access & Medication Discovery:** Establish the core project infrastructure, implement a complete user registration and role-based authentication system, and deliver the public-facing medication search functionality.
*   **Epic 2: End-to-End Prescription Submission Workflow:** Develop the primary customer journey, allowing authenticated clients to upload a prescription image and receive asynchronous status updates via the in-app notification system.
*   **Epic 3: Core Order Fulfillment Workflow:** Build the essential internal workflow for staff, enabling them to process submitted prescriptions, create corresponding orders with transactional stock management, and update order statuses.
*   **Epic 4: Administrative System Management:** Implement the core management tools for the 'Manager' role, providing the ability to manage the medication catalog, client accounts, and employee accounts.
