# Out of Scope for MVP

To ensure a focused and timely delivery of the core value proposition, the following features and capabilities are explicitly excluded from the MVP scope. They will be considered for future development phases based on user feedback and business priorities.

*   **Pharmacist Advice System:** The entire workflow for clients submitting questions and pharmacists responding will not be included.
*   **Low-Stock Reporting:** The dedicated report for managers to view low-inventory items is deferred.
*   **Advanced Order & Search Functionality:** Features such as searching/filtering orders, assigning orders to specific delivery personnel, and advanced medication search (e.g., by category) are out of scope.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** The MVP will rely on asynchronous, database-backed notifications. Any form of real-time updates (via WebSockets or polling) is not included.
*   **Client Inactivity Auto-Logout:** The automatic session timeout for inactive clients is a post-MVP enhancement.
