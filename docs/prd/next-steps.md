# Next Steps

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) is now considered complete and has been formally validated. It serves as the single source of truth for the project's scope, requirements, and user-centric goals. The following prompts are designed to provide a clear and actionable handoff to the next key roles in the development lifecycle: the UX Expert (or Design Architect) and the Architect.

## UX Expert Prompt

- Based on the approved **Pharmacy Management System PRD**, your task is to create the necessary design artifacts to guide the frontend development.
- Your primary inputs are the **"User Interface Design Goals"** section and the detailed user stories and acceptance criteria within each epic.
- Your deliverables should include wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for the **"Core Screens and Views"** listed, ensuring the final design adheres to the specified **WCAG AA accessibility** standards and the **dark Material theme**.

## Architect Prompt

- This approved **Pharmacy Management System PRD** is now ready for the architectural design phase. Your task is to create the formal **Architecture Document** that will serve as the technical blueprint for development.
- You are to treat the **"Technical Assumptions"** and **"Non-Functional Requirements"** sections of this PRD as **binding constraints**. The architecture you design must adhere strictly to the specified technology stack (Flutter/Android, Laravel, SQLite), monolithic service architecture, and monorepo structure.
- Your design must provide a clear implementation path for all epics and user stories defined herein, ensuring all functional requirements and business logic (e.g., transactional stock management, role-based access control) are fully supported.

### Success Criteria for the Architecture Document

A successful Architecture Document, based on this PRD, will be one that:

1.  **Adheres to All Constraints:** Explicitly demonstrates how the design adheres to every binding constraint listed in the "Technical Assumptions" and "Non-Functional Requirements" sections, with a particular focus on the mandatory use of Laravel, Flutter/Android, and SQLite.
2.  **Provides a Complete Technical Blueprint:** Outlines a clear and actionable technical implementation plan for every epic and user story in this PRD.
3.  **Defines Clear Data Structures:** Includes a finalized database schema (ERD) and detailed data models that support all required functionality.
4.  **Specifies API Contracts:** Provides a detailed API specification (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger format) for all endpoints, including request/response payloads and status codes.
5.  **Outlines Component Interaction:** Clearly illustrates how the major components of the system (Flutter App, Laravel API, SQLite DB) will interact to fulfill the user journeys.
6.  **Is Actionable for Development:** Is written with enough clarity and detail that a development team can begin implementation directly from the document with minimal ambiguity.
