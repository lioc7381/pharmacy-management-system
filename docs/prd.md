# Pharmacy Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Provide customers with a convenient, transparent, and reliable digital channel to manage their prescriptions and health inquiries.
*   Increase operational efficiency by reducing the manual effort required to process prescriptions from submission to delivery.
*   Improve inventory management to minimize revenue loss from stockouts and reduce capital waste from overstocking.
*   Enhance customer retention and loyalty by delivering a modern, high-quality digital experience.
*   Protect pharmacists' clinical focus by creating a structured, asynchronous system for managing patient questions, thereby reducing administrative interruptions.

### Background Context

The pharmacy's current reliance on manual, disconnected workflows creates significant friction for both customers and internal staff. Customers face an inconvenient and opaque process for managing prescriptions, requiring physical visits or phone calls for routine tasks. This results in a poor user experience that fails to meet modern expectations for digital convenience.

Internally, the lack of a unified digital system leads to operational inefficiencies, a high risk of human error, and a lack of real-time data for management. This project is a strategic imperative to build a foundational digital platform that will streamline operations, empower customers with self-service tools, and provide the data visibility needed for effective business management, ensuring the pharmacy's long-term viability and ability to innovate.

## Requirements

### Functional

*   **FR1:** The system shall allow any user (public or authenticated) to search for medications by name and view their details, including price and availability.
*   **FR2:** The system shall provide a registration workflow for new users, who will be assigned the 'Client' role by default. It must also provide a secure login/logout mechanism for all user roles.
*   **FR3:** Authenticated clients shall be able to submit a new prescription by selecting an image, which the client application will compress on-device before uploading.
*   **FR4:** The application must implement a simple, **read-only** caching strategy using local storage for non-critical data (e.g., search results, notifications). The cache is for display during brief network interruptions only; all actions that modify data are disabled when offline.
*   **FR5:** Authenticated managers shall have the ability to perform core administrative tasks, including managing client accounts, employee accounts, and the medication catalog.
*   **FR6:** The system shall provide a database-backed, in-app notification system to deliver asynchronous updates to users regarding their orders and other relevant events.

### Non-Functional

*   **NFR1:** The client-facing application shall be a mobile application built exclusively for the Android platform using Flutter.
*   **NFR2:** The backend shall be a REST API built with Laravel, using SQLite as the exclusive database to ensure portability and meet the zero-budget constraint.
*   **NFR3:** All user-facing communication that is not instantaneous (e.g., advice responses, order updates) shall be handled asynchronously via the notification system, with no requirement for real-time technologies like WebSockets.
*   **NFR4:** The application must implement a simple, read-only caching strategy for non-critical data (e.g., search results, notifications) to improve the user experience during brief network interruptions.
*   **NFR5:** The entire system must be deliverable with a zero-dollar budget for third-party services or hosting.
*   **NFR6:** The user interface shall be designed with a mobile-first, dark Material theme.
*   **NFR7:** The client application must perform on-device image compression for prescription uploads to ensure files are under a 5MB limit.

## Out of Scope for MVP

To ensure a focused and timely delivery of the core value proposition, the following features and capabilities are explicitly excluded from the MVP scope. They will be considered for future development phases based on user feedback and business priorities.

*   **Pharmacist Advice System:** The entire workflow for clients submitting questions and pharmacists responding will not be included.
*   **Low-Stock Reporting:** The dedicated report for managers to view low-inventory items is deferred.
*   **Advanced Order & Search Functionality:** Features such as searching/filtering orders, assigning orders to specific delivery personnel, and advanced medication search (e.g., by category) are out of scope.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** The MVP will rely on asynchronous, database-backed notifications. Any form of real-time updates (via WebSockets or polling) is not included.
*   **Client Inactivity Auto-Logout:** The automatic session timeout for inactive clients is a post-MVP enhancement.

---

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience must be modern, intuitive, and efficient, directly contrasting the high-friction manual processes it replaces. The design should inspire confidence and trust, ensuring that both customers and staff perceive the application as a reliable and streamlined tool. Key principles are clarity, simplicity, and speed, minimizing the number of steps required to complete core tasks like submitting a prescription or processing an order.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

The application will adhere to standard mobile interaction patterns familiar to Android users. This includes taps, swipes, and scrolling for navigation, along with standard form inputs for data entry. A key interaction will be the image selection and upload workflow for prescriptions, which must be seamless and straightforward.

### Primary Navigation

To ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience, the application will use a **Bottom Navigation Bar** for primary navigation on the main authenticated screens. The navigation bar will be visible to all authenticated user roles but will display different tabs based on the user's role.

*   **Client Role:**
    *   Dashboard / Home
    *   Submit Prescription
    *   My Orders
    *   Notifications
*   **Staff Roles (Salesperson, Delivery, etc.):**
    *   Dashboard / Queue
    *   Order Management
    *   Notifications
*   **Manager Role:**
    *   Dashboard
    *   Management (leading to sub-screens for Client, Staff, and Medication management)
    *   Notifications

Secondary navigation (e.g., navigating from a list to a detail view) will be handled through standard screen-to-screen transitions.

### Responsive Design

While the application is "Mobile Only (Android)", it must be responsive enough to provide a usable experience across a range of screen sizes, from small phones to larger tablets in portrait orientation.

*   **Layouts:** Use fluid layouts (e.g., Flutter's `Expanded` and `Flexible` widgets) that adapt to the available width. Avoid fixed-width elements.
*   **Breakpoints:** While a complex breakpoint system is not required for the MVP, the UI should not break or have overflow errors on common device widths (e.g., 360dp to 800dp).
*   **Text:** Text should wrap correctly and remain legible on all screen sizes.
*   **Orientation:** The application should be locked to **portrait mode** to simplify the responsive design effort for the MVP.

### Core Screens and Views

This is a conceptual list of the essential screens required to deliver the MVP functionality, intended to guide the Design Architect:

*   Login / Registration Screen
*   Public Medication Search Screen
*   Client Dashboard (Main authenticated screen for clients)
*   Prescription Submission Form (including image selection)
*   Order History / Status List (for clients)
*   Staff Dashboard (Role-specific view for authenticated staff)
*   Prescription Processing Queue (for staff)
*   Order Management View (for staff)
*   Notification Center
*   Client Management Screen (for searching, viewing, and editing clients)
*   Staff Management Screen (for adding, viewing, and editing employees)
*   Medication Management Screen (for adding, viewing, and editing medications)

### Accessibility

Accessibility: WCAG AA

### Branding

The application will use a clean, mobile-first, dark Material theme. No specific corporate branding elements (logos, color palettes) have been provided at this stage.

### Target Device and Platforms

Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only (Android)

## Technical Assumptions

This section documents the key technical decisions and constraints that will guide the Architect. These choices are derived directly from the project's foundational documents and are considered binding for the MVP.

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

A single repository will be used to house both the Flutter frontend application and the Laravel backend API. This approach is chosen for its simplicity, which aligns with the project's constraints as an educational capstone managed by a single developer. It simplifies version control, setup, and dependency management.

### Service Architecture: Monolith

The backend will be a single, monolithic Laravel service. This architecture is the most direct and efficient way to deliver the required functionality while avoiding the unnecessary operational complexity of microservices or serverless functions, which are explicitly out of scope.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

The testing strategy will focus on a pragmatic mix of unit and integration tests. This includes unit tests for critical backend business logic (e.g., stock management), widget tests for key Flutter screens, and at least one end-to-end integration test covering a complete user journey to validate the full stack.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

The following are critical technical directives consolidated from the project's technical requirements and must be adhered to by the Architect:

*   **Platform & Frameworks:** The frontend will be built **only for Android** using **Flutter**. The backend will be a **Laravel REST API**.
*   **Database:** The system will **only use SQLite**. It will not be designed for or tested against any other database system.
*   **Authentication:** API security will be managed exclusively by **Laravel Sanctum** for token-based authentication.
*   **State Management:** The Flutter application will use the **Provider** package for state management.
*   **Communication Protocol:** All client-server communication will be **asynchronous and REST-based**. Real-time technologies like WebSockets are explicitly forbidden for the MVP.
*   **File Handling:** The system must handle prescription image uploads, including client-side compression and secure server-side storage.

---

## Epic List

This section outlines the high-level epics required to deliver the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The epics are structured to be logically sequential, with each one delivering a significant, end-to-end increment of testable functionality. This structure allows for iterative development, starting with the foundational infrastructure and progressively building out the core user journeys for each role.

*   **Epic 1: Foundation, User Access & Medication Discovery:** Establish the core project infrastructure, implement a complete user registration and role-based authentication system, and deliver the public-facing medication search functionality.
*   **Epic 2: End-to-End Prescription Submission Workflow:** Develop the primary customer journey, allowing authenticated clients to upload a prescription image and receive asynchronous status updates via the in-app notification system.
*   **Epic 3: Core Order Fulfillment Workflow:** Build the essential internal workflow for staff, enabling them to process submitted prescriptions, create corresponding orders with transactional stock management, and update order statuses.
*   **Epic 4: Administrative System Management:** Implement the core management tools for the 'Manager' role, providing the ability to manage the medication catalog, client accounts, and employee accounts.

---

## Epic 1: Foundation, User Access & Medication Discovery

**Epic Goal:** To establish the complete project foundation, including the monorepo structure, core application setup for both Flutter and Laravel, and a basic CI workflow. This epic will deliver the complete, end-to-end user authentication system (registration, login, role-based access control) and the first piece of tangible user value: the public-facing medication search functionality.

### Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Core Setup

As a Developer,
I want a complete project scaffold for the Flutter and Laravel applications within a single monorepo,
so that I have a stable and consistent foundation for all future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A Git monorepo is initialized containing two primary directories: `frontend` (for Flutter) and `backend` (for Laravel).
2.  The Laravel backend is configured to use SQLite for its database, and the initial database migrations can be run successfully.
3.  The Flutter application is initialized with a clean, feature-based folder structure and necessary dependencies (Provider, Dio, etc.).
4.  A basic health-check endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/health`) is created in Laravel that returns a `200 OK` status.
5.  The Flutter app can successfully make an API call to the health-check endpoint.
6.  A root `README.md` file is created with comprehensive setup instructions. This must include prerequisites and a step-by-step guide covering:
 *   Initial project creation (e.g., `laravel new backend`).
 *   Dependency installation (`composer install`, `flutter pub get`).
 *   **Crucial framework setup, including the command to install Sanctum for an API-only SPA (`php artisan install:api`).**
 *   Environment configuration (`.env` setup, `php artisan key:generate`).
 *   Database setup (`php artisan migrate --seed`).
 *   Instructions for running both services concurrently.
7.  A Laravel database seeder is implemented and documented in the README. The seeder must populate the database with sample data, including at least one user for each role (Manager, Salesperson, etc.) and a small catalog of sample medications, to make the system immediately testable.

### Story 1.2: Implement Public Medication Search

As a User,
I want to search for medications by name and view their details,
so that I can check for availability and pricing without needing an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A public API endpoint (`GET /api/medications`) is created that allows searching for medications by name.
2.  The Flutter application has a search screen with a text input field.
3.  As the user types, the app calls the API and displays a list of matching medications, showing name, price, and availability.
4.  If no medications match the search term, a "No results found" message is displayed.
5.  If a network error occurs, a "Connection problem. Please try again." message is displayed.

### Story 1.3: Implement User Authentication API

As a System,
I want secure API endpoints for user registration and login,
so that users can create accounts and authenticate securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `POST /api/register` endpoint is created that accepts user details and creates a new account with the 'Client' role by default.
2.  The registration endpoint returns an error if the email is already in use.
3.  A `POST /api/login` endpoint is created that validates credentials and returns a Laravel Sanctum API token upon success.
4.  The login endpoint returns an "Invalid credentials" error for incorrect login attempts.
5.  A `POST /api/logout` endpoint is created that in-validates the user's current Sanctum token on the server.

### Story 1.4: Implement Client Registration & Login UI

As a Visitor,
I want to create an account and log in through the mobile app,
so that I can access authenticated features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A registration screen is built in Flutter that captures user details and calls the `POST /api/register` endpoint.
2.  A login screen is built that captures credentials and calls the `POST /api/login` endpoint.
3.  Upon successful login, the Sanctum API token is securely stored on the device.
4.  All subsequent authenticated API calls from the app include the stored token in the `Authorization` header.
5.  Upon successful logout, the token is cleared from local storage and the user is returned to the login screen.
6.  Backend validation for registration must enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters. The UI must display this requirement clearly if validation fails.
7.  The registration screen must include a mandatory 'I accept the Terms of Use' checkbox. The system must prevent registration if the box is not checked.

### Story 1.5: Implement Foundational Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

As a System,
I want to protect API endpoints based on user roles,
so that users can only access data and perform actions they are authorized for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Laravel middleware is created that can check the authenticated user's role against a list of allowed roles.
2.  A test endpoint (e.g., `/api/admin-test`) is created and protected by this middleware, restricted to the 'Manager' role.
3.  When a user with the 'Manager' role accesses the test endpoint, they receive a `200 OK` response.
4.  When a user with a 'Client' role (or no authentication) attempts to access the test endpoint, they receive a `403 Forbidden` error.

### Story 1.6: Implement Foundational Caching for Read-Only Data

As a User,
I want the app to cache non-critical data,
so that I have a better experience during brief network interruptions and data loads faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A simple, in-memory caching solution is added to the Flutter application's API service layer.
2.  API responses for public medication searches (`GET /api/medications`) are cached for a short duration (e.g., 5 minutes).
3.  API responses for the user's notifications (`GET /api/notifications`) are cached. When the cache is displayed, a background request to fetch fresh data is still initiated.
4.  The cache is invalidated when the user logs out.
5.  This implementation must satisfy the requirements of NFR4.

---

## Epic 2: End-to-End Prescription Submission Workflow

**Epic Goal:** To deliver the primary customer value proposition by building the complete, end-to-end workflow for a client to submit a prescription. This epic includes the creation of the foundational notification system, the secure API for file uploads, and the client-facing UI for both submitting a prescription and viewing subsequent status updates.

### Story 2.1: Implement Foundational Notification System (Backend)

As a System,
I want a backend mechanism to create, store, and retrieve user-specific notifications,
so that important asynchronous updates can be delivered reliably to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `Notifications` table is created in the database with fields for user ID, title, message, and a read status.
2.  An internal service or method is created that allows other parts of the backend (e.g., the prescription service) to generate a notification for a specific user.
3.  A secure API endpoint (`GET /api/notifications`) is created that fetches all notifications for the currently authenticated user.
4.  The API endpoint for fetching notifications returns them in reverse chronological order (newest first).

### Story 2.2: Implement Prescription Submission API

As a System,
I want a secure API endpoint for clients to upload a prescription image,
so that their submissions can be received and stored for processing by staff.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `POST /api/prescriptions` endpoint is created and protected by middleware, accessible only to users with the 'Client' role.
2.  The endpoint accepts an image file (JPG, PNG) and validates that its size is under the 5MB limit.
3.  Upon successful upload, the image is stored securely on the server, and a new record is created in the `Prescriptions` table with a 'pending' status.
4.  The API response for a successful submission must include the unique reference number for the created prescription record.
5.  After the prescription record is created, the system generates an in-app notification for the client that includes the reference number (e.g., "Your prescription #P12345 has been submitted successfully!").
6.  If the file is invalid (type or size), the endpoint returns a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error with a clear message.

### Story 2.3: Build Prescription Submission UI

As a Client,
I want to upload a prescription image through the app,
so that I can submit it for processing without visiting the pharmacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Submit Prescription" screen is created in the Flutter app, accessible to logged-in clients.
2.  The user can tap a button to select an image from their device's gallery or camera.
3.  The application performs client-side compression on the selected image before uploading.
4.  Upon tapping "Submit," the app calls the `POST /api/prescriptions` endpoint with the compressed image.
5.  A success message is displayed to the user upon a successful submission, which includes the reference number returned by the API (e.g., "Submission successful! Your reference is #P12345.").
6.  If the upload fails due to a network error or server validation error, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

### Story 2.4: Implement Notification Viewing UI

As a Client,
I want to view a list of my notifications,
so that I can stay informed about the status of my prescriptions and other important updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Notifications" screen is created in the Flutter app, accessible to logged-in clients.
2.  The screen calls the `GET /api/notifications` endpoint to fetch and display the user's notifications.
3.  Notifications are displayed in a list, with the newest items at the top.
4.  A visual indicator (e.g., a dot) is present on unread notifications.
5.  If the user has no notifications, a message like "You have no new notifications" is displayed.
6.  Upon successfully loading the notification list, any app-wide notification indicators (e.g., a badge on the navigation bar) are cleared.

---

## Epic 3: Core Order Fulfillment Workflow

**Epic Goal:** To build the essential internal workflow for pharmacy staff, enabling them to efficiently process submitted prescriptions, create corresponding orders with robust, transactional stock management, and manage the order's status through to the point of delivery handoff. This epic delivers the core operational value proposition of the system.

### Story 3.1: Implement Staff Prescription Queue

As a Salesperson,
I want to view a queue of all pending prescriptions,
so that I can begin processing new client submissions in a timely manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A secure API endpoint is created that returns a list of all prescriptions with a 'pending' status.
2.  The Flutter application has a "Prescription Queue" screen, accessible only to authenticated staff with the 'Salesperson' role or higher.
3.  The screen calls the API and displays the pending prescriptions in a list, showing key information like the client's name and submission time.
4.  If there are no pending prescriptions, a message "No pending prescriptions to process" is displayed.
5.  Tapping on a prescription in the list navigates the user to the processing screen (to be built in Story 3.2).

### Story 3.2: Process Prescription into an Order

As a Salesperson,
I want to process a submitted prescription by creating a new order with the specified medications,
so that I can fulfill the client's request and begin the preparation workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**UI & Interaction:**

1.  Given the Salesperson is on the 'Prescription Processing' screen, Then the client's uploaded prescription image is displayed prominently.
2.  Given the Salesperson is processing a prescription, Then they can search for medications by name and add them to a list, specifying a quantity for each. **The UI must display the current stock availability for each medication as it is being added.**

**Backend - Happy Path & Business Logic:**

3.  When the 'Create Order' API endpoint is called, it MUST first validate that the `current_quantity` for each medication in the request is greater than or equal to the requested quantity.
4.  Given a successful stock validation, the creation of the order and all related database updates MUST occur within a single database transaction to ensure data integrity.
5.  Given a successful transaction, the `current_quantity` for each medication in the `Medications` table MUST be decremented by the ordered quantity.
6.  Given a successful transaction, the `status` of the corresponding record in the `Prescriptions` table MUST be updated to 'Processed'.
7.  Given a successful transaction, a new record MUST be created in the `Orders` table with a `status` of 'In Preparation'.
8.  Given a successful transaction, a new record MUST be created in the `Notifications` table for the client, containing the new Order ID.

**Backend & UI - Exception/Error Handling:**

9.  When the 'Create Order' API endpoint is called and at least one medication has insufficient stock, Then the API MUST return a `409 Conflict` error with a message identifying the out-of-stock item(s).
10. Given the API returns a `409 Conflict` error for insufficient stock, Then the frontend MUST display a clear, non-dismissible error message to the Salesperson, and the order creation process MUST be halted.

### Story 3.3: Reject Invalid Prescription

As a Salesperson,
I want to reject an invalid prescription submission and provide a reason,
so that the submission is removed from the active queue and the client is informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Given the Salesperson is on the 'Prescription Processing' screen, a 'Reject' button is available.
2.  When the 'Reject' button is tapped, the system prompts the Salesperson to enter a mandatory reason for the rejection (e.g., "Image is blurry," "Prescription is incomplete").
3.  Upon confirming the rejection, a secure API endpoint updates the prescription's status to 'Rejected' and saves the rejection reason.
4.  The system generates an in-app notification for the client informing them that their submission was rejected and includes the reason provided by the Salesperson.
5.  A rejected prescription is removed from the main 'pending' queue for Salespeople.

### Story 3.4: Manage Order Status

As a Salesperson,
I want to manage the status of an order,
so that I can track its progress through the fulfillment workflow and prepare it for delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  An "Order Management" screen allows the Salesperson to view orders, filterable by status (e.g., 'In Preparation', 'Ready for Delivery').
2.  The Salesperson can change an order's status from 'In Preparation' to 'Ready for Delivery'.
3.  When an order's status is updated to 'Ready for Delivery', the system sends an in-app notification to the client.
4.  The API endpoints for updating status are protected and accessible only to authorized staff.

### Story 3.5: Fulfill Delivery

As a Delivery Person,
I want to view my assigned deliveries and update their final status,
so that the system has an accurate, real-time record of the order's completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "My Deliveries" screen is available to users with the 'Delivery' role, showing a list of orders assigned to them with the status 'Ready for Delivery'.
2.  The Delivery Person can update an order's status to 'Completed' upon successful delivery.
3.  The Delivery Person can update an order's status to 'Failed Delivery' if the delivery could not be completed.
4.  Once an order's status is updated to 'Completed' or 'Failed Delivery', it is removed from the Delivery Person's active queue.
5.  The system sends a final notification to the client when their order is marked as 'Completed'.

---

## Epic 4: Administrative System Management

**Epic Goal:** To empower the 'Manager' role with the essential administrative tools to manage the system's foundational data, including the medication catalog, client accounts, and employee accounts. This epic ensures the system is maintainable and can be administered effectively post-launch.

### Story 4.1: Manage Medication Catalog

As a Manager,
I want to add, edit, and disable medications in the catalog,
so that I can maintain an accurate and up-to-date list of available products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Medication Management" screen is created in the Flutter app, accessible only to users with the 'Manager' role.
2.  The screen provides functionality to search for existing medications and initiate adding a new one.
3.  Secure API endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` on `/api/medications`) are implemented and protected by middleware, accessible only to the 'Manager' role.
4.  The UI allows a Manager to create a new medication by providing all required details (Name, Price, Initial Quantity, etc.).
5.  The UI allows a Manager to edit the details of an existing medication.
6.  The UI allows a Manager to disable a medication. The system must prevent this action if the medication is part of any order that is not in a 'Completed' or 'Cancelled' state, displaying an appropriate error message.
7.  Medications marked as 'disabled' must not appear in public search results for clients.

### Story 4.2: Manage Client Accounts

As a Manager,
I want to view, edit, and disable client accounts,
so that I can manage the user base and handle administrative requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Client Management" screen is created in the Flutter app, accessible only to users with the 'Manager' role.
2.  The screen provides functionality to search for clients by name or email.
3.  Secure API endpoints (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` on `/api/clients/{id}`) are implemented and protected by middleware, accessible only to the 'Manager' role.
4.  The UI allows a Manager to edit a client's details (e.g., Name, Email).
5.  The UI allows a Manager to disable a client's account. The system must prevent this action if the client has any orders that are not in a 'Completed' or 'Cancelled' state, displaying an appropriate error message.
6.  A user whose account is disabled must be prevented from logging into the application.

### Story 4.3: Manage Employee Accounts

As a Manager,
I want to add, edit, and disable employee accounts and assign their roles,
so that I can manage staff access to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Staff Management" screen is created in the Flutter app, accessible only to users with the 'Manager' role.
2.  Secure API endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` on `/api/employees`) are implemented and protected by middleware, accessible only to the 'Manager' role.
3.  The UI form for adding a new employee must include a dropdown menu to assign a specific role (e.g., 'Pharmacist', 'Salesperson', 'Delivery').
4.  The UI allows a Manager to edit an existing employee's details, including their assigned role.
5.  The UI allows a Manager to disable an employee's account. The system must prevent this action if the employee is assigned to any active orders.
6.  A user whose employee account is disabled must be prevented from logging into the application.

### UX Expert Prompt

- Based on the approved **Pharmacy Management System PRD**, your task is to create the necessary design artifacts to guide the frontend development.
- Your primary inputs are the **"User Interface Design Goals"** section and the detailed user stories and acceptance criteria within each epic.
- Your deliverables should include wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for the **"Core Screens and Views"** listed, ensuring the final design adheres to the specified **WCAG AA accessibility** standards and the **dark Material theme**.

### Architect Prompt

- This approved **Pharmacy Management System PRD** is now ready for the architectural design phase. Your task is to create the formal **Architecture Document** that will serve as the technical blueprint for development.
- You are to treat the **"Technical Assumptions"** and **"Non-Functional Requirements"** sections of this PRD as **binding constraints**. The architecture you design must adhere strictly to the specified technology stack (Flutter/Android, Laravel, SQLite), monolithic service architecture, and monorepo structure.
- Your design must provide a clear implementation path for all epics and user stories defined herein, ensuring all functional requirements and business logic (e.g., transactional stock management, role-based access control) are fully supported.

#### Success Criteria for the Architecture Document

A successful Architecture Document, based on this PRD, will be one that:

1.  **Adheres to All Constraints:** Explicitly demonstrates how the design adheres to every binding constraint listed in the "Technical Assumptions" and "Non-Functional Requirements" sections, with a particular focus on the mandatory use of Laravel, Flutter/Android, and SQLite.
2.  **Provides a Complete Technical Blueprint:** Outlines a clear and actionable technical implementation plan for every epic and user story in this PRD.
3.  **Defines Clear Data Structures:** Includes a finalized database schema (ERD) and detailed data models that support all required functionality.
4.  **Specifies API Contracts:** Provides a detailed API specification (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger format) for all endpoints, including request/response payloads and status codes.
5.  **Outlines Component Interaction:** Clearly illustrates how the major components of the system (Flutter App, Laravel API, SQLite DB) will interact to fulfill the user journeys.
6.  **Is Actionable for Development:** Is written with enough clarity and detail that a development team can begin implementation directly from the document with minimal ambiguity.
